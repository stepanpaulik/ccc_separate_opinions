  {"id":"abbottHardSoftLaw2000","abstract":"We examine why international actors-including states, firms, and activists-seek different types of legalized arrangements to solve political and substantive problems. We show how particular forms of legalization provide superior institutional solutions in different circumstances. We begin by examining the baseline advantages of \"hard\" legalization (that is, precise, legally binding obligations with appropriate third-party delegation). We emphasize, however, that actors often prefer softer forms of legalization (that is, various combinations of reduced precision, less stringent obligation, and weaker delegation). Soft legalization has a number of significant advantages, including that it is easier to achieve, provides strategies for dealing with uncertainty, infringes less on sovereignty, and facilitates compromise among differentiated actors. Although our approach is largely interest-based, we explicitly incorporate the normative elements that are central in law and in recent international relations theorizing. We also consider the important role of nonstate actors who, along with states, are central participants in contemporary international legalization. We illustrate the advantages of various forms of international legal arrangements with examples drawn from articles in this special issue and elsewhere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbott","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Snidal","given":"Duncan"}],"citation-key":"abbottHardSoftLaw2000","container-title":"International Organization","ISSN":"0020-8183","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"421-456","publisher":"[MIT Press, University of Wisconsin Press, Cambridge University Press, International Organization Foundation]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Hard and Soft Law in International Governance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2601340","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"alexyConstitutionalRightsBalancing2003","abstract":"The article begins with an outline of the balancing construction as developed by the German Federal Constitutional court since the Lüth decision in 1958. It then takes up two objections to this approach raised by Jürgen Habermas. The ﬁrst maintains that balancing is both irrational and a danger for rights, depriving them of their normative power. The second is that balancing takes one out of the realm of right and wrong, correctness and incorrectness, and justiﬁcation, and, thus, out of the realm of the law. The article attempts to counter these objections by showing that there exists a rational structure of balancing that can be made explicit by a “Law of Balancing” and a “Disproportionality Rule.” These rules show, ﬁrst, that balancing is not a danger for rights but, on the contrary, a necessary means of lending them protection, and second, that balancing is not an alternative to argumentation but an indispensable form of rational practical discourse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexy","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"alexyConstitutionalRightsBalancing2003","container-title":"Ratio Juris","ISSN":"0952-1917, 1467-9337","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,6]]},"language":"en","page":"131-140","source":"Crossref","title":"Constitutional Rights, Balancing, and Rationality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/1467-9337.00228","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"alexyTheoryConstitutionalRights2002","abstract":"In any country where there is a Bill of Rights, constitutional rights reasoning is an important part of the legal process. As more and more countries adopt Human Rights legislation and accede to international human rights agreements, and as the European Union introduces its own Bill of Rights,judges struggle to implement these rights consistently and sometimes the reasoning behind them is lost. Examining the practice in other jurisdictions can be a valuable guide. Robert Alexy's classic work reconstructs the reasoning behind the jurisprudence of the German Basic Law and in doing soprovides a theory of general application to all jurisdictions where judges wrestle with rights adjudication. In considering the features of constitutional rights reasoning, the author moves from the doctrine of proportionality, procedural rights and the structure and scope of constitutional rights, to general rights of liberty and equality and the problem of horizontal effect. A postscript written for theEnglish edition considers critiques of the Theory since it first appeared in 1985, focusing in particular on the discretion left to legislatures and in an extended introduction the translator argues that the theory may be used to clarify the nature of legal reasoning in the context of rights underthe British Constitution. This book will be of central interest to all legal and constitutional theorists and human rights scholars.","author":[{"family":"Alexy","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"alexyTheoryConstitutionalRights2002","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-958423-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"518","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"A Theory of Constitutional Rights","type":"book"},
  {"id":"alterEuropeanCourtPolitical1996","abstract":"The European Court has emerged as one of the most powerful political institutions in the European Union and the most influential international court in existence. National courts are the linchpins of the European legal system, making European Court decisions enforceable and creating an independent power base for the European Court. This article examines why national courts agreed to take on a role enforcing European law supremacy against their own governments and why national politicians did not stop an institutional transformation of the European legal system which greatly compromised national sovereignty. Competition between lower and higher national courts, each trying to enhance their influence and authority vis‐à‐vis each other, explains how national legal interpretive barriers and high‐court ambivalence regarding the European Court's declaration of European Law Supremacy was overcome. Politicians proved unable to reverse national court acceptance of European law supremacy, and institutional rules kept politicians from sanctioning either national courts or the European Court for judicial activism. Legal doctrine became a form of institution‐building, and a mechanism to make international law enforceable was created, giving the European Court the ability to make unpopular decisions and to compel compliance with European law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Alter","given":"Karen J."}],"citation-key":"alterEuropeanCourtPolitical1996","container-title":"West European Politics","DOI":"10.1080/01402389608425146","ISSN":"0140-2382","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,7,1]]},"number":"3","page":"458-487","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The European Court's political power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01402389608425146","volume":"19"},

The basic balancing rule establishes a general criterion for deciding between the marginal benefit to the public good and the marginal limit to human rights.

The institution is given a shield to protect against the attentions of another body, or is given a sword it can use to repel an attack. Self-defence mechanisms are interesting for many reasons, but particularly for the light they cast on the separation of powers. These measures seem contrary to the normal prescriptions of that principle, allocating a capacity to a body that it appears ill suited to possess. Understanding why the separation of powers requires these surprising allocations helps explain its operation in ordinary contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Barber","given":"N.

The study is of an unprecedented size and scope. It covers every tenured or tenure-track faculty member at 19 U.S. law schools, a total of 623 professors. The study gathers four years of teaching evaluation data (calendar years 2000–2003) and tests for associations between the teaching data and five different measures of research productivity/scholarly influence. The results are counterintuitive: there is either no correlation or a slight positive correlation between teaching effectiveness and any of the five measures of research productivity. Given the breadth of the study, this finding is quite robust. These findings should help inform debates about teaching and scholarship among law school and other faculties and likely require some soul-searching about the interaction between the two most important functions of U.S. law schools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Barton","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"bartonThereCorrelationLaw2008","container-title":"Journal of Empirical Legal Studies","DOI":"10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00135.x","ISSN":"1740-1461","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2008, Copyright the Author.

The aim is to demonstrate how norm-conform behaviour unfolds, or fails to unfold, in an interaction between a member state and the European Commission. The empirical focus is on recent rule of law crises in France, Hungary and Romania. The argument is that member states engage in symbolic and/or creative compliance, designed to create the appearance of norm-conform behaviour without giving up their original objectives. The cases illustrate that creative and symbolic compliance strategies may be successfully employed by member states because they enable the Commission to disengage from conflicts it judges too costly and yet maintain its credibility, and are conditioned by the visibility of failure to change facts on the ground. The implication is that, at times, not only is compliance symbolic, but also to some extent is enforcement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Batory","given":"Agnes"}],"citation-key":"batoryDefyingCommissionCreative2016","container-title":"Public Administration","container-title-short":"Public Administration","ISSN":"00333298","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"page":"685","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Defying the Commission: Creative Compliance and Respect for the Rule of Law in the Eu","title-short":"Defying the Commission","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ezproxy.muni.cz/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,cookie,uid&db=edb&AN=118094100&lang=cs&site=eds-live&scope=site","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"bellamyRuleLawSeparation2017","abstract":"\"The rule of law is frequently invoked in political debate, yet rarely defined with any precision. Some employ it as a synonym for democracy, others for the subordination of the legislature to a written constitution and its judicial guardians. It has been seen as obedience to the duly-recognised government, a form of governing through formal and general rule-like laws and the rule of principle. Given this diversity of view, it is perhaps unsurprising that certain scholars have regarded the concept as no more than a self-congratulatory rhetorical device. This collection of eighteen key essays from jurists, political theorists and public law political scientists, aims to explore the role law plays in the political system. The introduction evaluates their arguments. The first eleven essays identify the standard features associated with the rule of law. These are held to derive less from any characteristics of law per se than from a style of legislating and judging that gives equal consideration to all citizens. The next seven essays then explore how different ways of separating and dispersing power contribute to this democratic style of rule by forcing politicians and judges alike to treat people as equals and regard none as above the law.\"--Provided by publisher.","author":[{"family":"Bellamy","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"bellamyRuleLawSeparation2017","ISBN":"978-1-315-08530-2 978-1-351-54070-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 994229083","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The Rule of Law and the Separation of Powers","type":"book"},

Just before US presidential elections, judges on the US courts of appeals double the rate at which they dissent and vote along partisan lines. Increases are accentuated for judges with less experience and in polarized environments. During periods of national unity—wartime, for example—judges suppress dissents, especially if they have less experience or are in polarized environments. We show that the dissent rate increases gradually from 6 percent to nearly 12 percent in the quarter before an election and returns immediately to 6 percent after the election. If highly experienced professionals making common-law precedent can be politically primed, it raises questions about the perceived impartiality of the judiciary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Berdejó","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Daniel L."}],"citation-key":"berdejoElectoralCyclesUS2017","container-title":"The Journal of Law and Economics","DOI":"10.1086/696237","ISSN":"0022-2186","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8]]},"page":"479-496","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Electoral Cycles among US Courts of Appeals Judges","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/696237","volume":"60"},

  {"id":"besselinkBiteBarkHowl","abstract":"This chapter analyses Article 7 TEU on sanctions against Member States for certain potential and actual breaches of the values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, and the related ‘Rule of Law initiatives’. It argues that the debates over these reveal a twofold boundary issue: that of the legal delimitation of the procedures and powers under Article 7, and that of the fuzzy boundaries of the Member State political orders as distinct from the EU political order.

The article argues that more can be done to maximize the effectiveness of existing judicial tools, such as infringement proceedings brought to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the Commission and private enforcement litigation in national courts. At the same time, we highlight risks inherent in many proposals for novel judicial tools to defend national democracy. We conclude that despite their importance, judicial safeguards alone – whether existing ones or novel proposals – will not suffice to stop democratic backsliding by a determined national government: if the Union is to rein in such attacks on its core values, heads of government and other EU leaders will have to intervene politically as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Blauberger","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kelemen","given":"R.

  {"id":"blaubergerEuropeanCourtJustice2017","abstract":"This article reviews recent advances in the study of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and its political impact at the European and member state levels. New quantitative as well as qualitative analyses show with great empirical precision that member state preferences guide the Court. The article summarises these findings, but argues that greater attention needs to be given to the (over-)constitutionalisation of EU law in order to fully capture the political impact of ECJ jurisprudence. Even if European judges are less activist than is often assumed and individual decisions are more restrained in the face of member state opposition, incrementally, case law evolves in a highly expansive fashion. And, exercising caution regarding unrealistic expectations about quasi-deterministic judicial law-making, it is found that the Court’s constitutionalised jurisprudence impacts heavily on European and member state policy-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Blauberger","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Susanne K."}],"citation-key":"blaubergerEuropeanCourtJustice2017","container-title":"West European Politics","container-title-short":"null","DOI":"10.1080/01402382.2017.1281652","ISSN":"0140-2382","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,4]]},"number":"4","page":"907-918","publisher":"Routledge","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk (Atypon)","title":"The European Court of Justice and its political impact","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2398/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2017.1281652","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"bluhmConservativeDevelopmentalStatism2020","abstract":"Russia, Hungary and Poland have been at the forefront of the illiberal counter-movement to neoliberalism. However, while there is increasing knowledge about how ‘populism’ as a discursive strategy has brought illiberals to power, especially in Poland and Hungary, we know surprisingly little about the socioeconomic programme and guiding principles of illiberals. In this article, we argue first that there is such a programme and that – notwithstanding the differences between countries – it features a similar programmatic core in the three countries that took shape in conservative think tanks and guides socioeconomic policy recommendations. Second, this programmatic core is best understood not so much as populism, but as a combination of economic nationalism – subordinating the economy to national interests and to the imperative of protecting national identity – and conservatism, reorienting economic policies to serve the traditional family and undo the perceived wrongdoings of post-communist elites, in particular, privatisation. We call this core conservative developmental statism. Thus illiberalism is reducible neither to populism nor to the whims of the power-holders of the day, and in these countries it needs to be seen in a wider context in which rightwing intellectuals have been working in parallel with politicians to give illiberalism a conservative content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Bluhm","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Varga","given":"Mihai"}],"citation-key":"bluhmConservativeDevelopmentalStatism2020","container-title":"New Political Economy","DOI":"10.1080/13563467.2019.1639146","ISSN":"1356-3467","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,6]]},"page":"642-659","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Conservative Developmental Statism in East Central Europe and Russia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13563467.2019.1639146","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"bockmanEasternEuropeLaboratory2002","abstract":"Using Latour's concepts of “actor‐network�” and “translation,” the authors show that neoliberalism's success in Eastern Europe is best analyzed not as an institutional form diffused along the nodes of a network, but as itself an actor‐network based on a particular �translation strategy� that construes socialism as a laboratory of economic knowledge. They argue that socialism was made into a laboratory of economic knowledge during the socialist calculation debate of the 1920s and 1930s. An extensive debate during the Cold War is also documented and shows that a transnational network continued to be organized around attempts to connect the results obtained in the socialist laboratory with debates and struggles in Western economics. Finally, the drafting of transition blueprints in postcommunist Eastern Europe after 1989, with the participation of American economists, is shown to be a continuation of this transnational network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Bockman","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Eyal","given":"Gil"}],"citation-key":"bockmanEasternEuropeLaboratory2002","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/344411","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,9,1]]},"page":"310-352","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Eastern Europe as a Laboratory for Economic Knowledge: The                     Transnational Roots of Neoliberalism","title-short":"Eastern Europe as a Laboratory for Economic Knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/344411","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"bonelliTariccoSagaConsolidation2018","abstract":"In December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union delivered its awaited decision on the Taricco II case, responding to a preliminary reference from the Italian Corte Costituzionale. The latter, unhappy with the outcome of the earlier Taricco I decision, asked for a re-interpretation of Article 325 TFEU and threatened the Court of Justice with the possible activation of its controlimiti doctrine. The CJEU partially ?corrected? its previous ruling and prevented an open conflict between EU law and Italian constitutional law. This case note discusses the saga and its three episodes against the background of the growing constitutional conversation between top European courts. It argues that Taricco is a positive episode of judicial dialogue and may further contribute to its consolidation: on one hand, constitutional courts are increasingly willing to ?play the game? and refer to the CJEU under Article 267 TFEU; on the other, the Court of Justice seems more reactive than in the past to constitutional courts? claims and now considers them with increasing attention and detail. Finally, the case note reflects on the partially diverging languages for constitutional dialogue: national courts use the language of constitutional identity, while the CJEU prefers to refer to the ?common constitutional principles of the EU?.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonelli","given":"Matteo"}],"citation-key":"bonelliTariccoSagaConsolidation2018","container-title":"Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law","container-title-short":"Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law","DOI":"10.1177/1023263X18773046","ISSN":"1023-263X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"number":"3","page":"357-373","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Taricco saga and the consolidation of judicial dialogue in the European Union: CJEU, C-105/14 Ivo Taricco and others, ECLI:EU:C:2015:555; and C-42/17 M.A.S., M.B., ECLI:EU:C:2017:936 Italian Constitutional Court, Order no. 24/2017","title-short":"The Taricco saga and the consolidation of judicial dialogue in the European Union","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1023263X18773046","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"boydUntanglingCausalEffects2010","abstract":"We explore the role of sex in judging by addressing two questions of long-standing interest to political scientists: whether and in what ways male and female judges decide cases distinctly—\"individual effects\"—and whether and in what ways serving with a female judge causes males to behave differently—\"panel effects.\" While we attend to the dominant theoretical accounts of why we might expect to observe either or both effects, we do not use the predominant statistical tools to assess them. Instead, we deploy a more appropriate methodology: semiparametric matching, which follows from a formal framework for causal inference. Applying matching methods to 13 areas of law, we observe consistent gender effects in only one—sex discrimination. For these disputes, the probability of a judge deciding in favor of the party alleging discrimination decreases by about 10 percentage points when the judge is a male. Likewise, when a woman serves on a panel with men, the men are significantly more likely to rule in favor of the rights litigant. These results are consistent with an informational account of gendered judging and are inconsistent with several others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyd","given":"Christina L."},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Andrew D."}],"citation-key":"boydUntanglingCausalEffects2010","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","ISSN":"0092-5853","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"389-411","publisher":"[Midwest Political Science Association, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Untangling the Causal Effects of Sex on Judging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25652213","volume":"54"},

When considering the number of references from different Member States, it will become immediately apparent that there are considerable variations. This article examines to what extent these variations may be explained by three structural factors, namely (1) population size, (2) willingness to litigate and (3) Member State compliance with EU law. It is concluded that some—but not all—of the variations in number of references from Member State judiciaries may be attributed to structural factors rather than being merely a reflection of different Member State courts’ willingness to make use of Article 267 TFEU on such references (the so-called behavioural factors).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Broberg","given":"Morten"},{"family":"Fenger","given":"Niels"}],"citation-key":"brobergVariationsMemberStates2013","container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/eulj.12045","ISSN":"1468-0386","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"488-501","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Variations in Member States’ Preliminary References to the Court of Justice—Are Structural Factors (Part of) the Explanation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eulj.12045","volume":"19"},

In these judgements, for the first time, the CC uses EU fundamental rights as a standard of review. In addition, the CC establishes a novel framework of “parallel applicability” of EU and domestic fundamental rights for subject matters that are not fully harmonized by EU law. The article first presents the new approach, showing that it structurally changes the parameters of the relationship between the CC and the CJEU. Second, the article assesses the legal-political tendency reflected in this change: is this constructive dialogue or rather pushback against the CJEU? The article argues that this new jurisprudence should be characterized as an instance of resistance. The CC resists against the CJEU in its function as fundamental rights court, attempting to reduce the authority of the CJEU and reversing a development that it considered to be unfavourable to its own authority. This is structural pushback aimed at the CJEU’s function rather than at individual decisions or norms - however, without rejection the CJEU as an institution altogether.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Burchardt","given":"Dana"}],"citation-key":"burchardtBacklashCourtJustice2020","container-title":"German Law Journal","DOI":"10.1017/glj.2020.16","ISSN":"2071-8322","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"en","number":"S1","page":"1-18","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Backlash against the Court of Justice of the EU?

This article focuses on the ideational dimension behind the current illiberal backlash in Central and Eastern Europe. We ask how political conceptions critical of the Western liberal paradigm came about and what their main components are in Hungary, a country which is often seen as the avant-garde of the ‘illiberal backsliding’ in the region. The article shows that political illiberalism in Eastern Europe has intellectual underpinnings forged in conservative intellectual networks that have grown disillusioned with liberal democracy and neoliberalism long before the current illiberal political wave. Combining the reception of Western critiques of liberalism with a critique of post-communist liberals’ perceived lack of willingness to break with the communist past, these intellectuals have slowly but continuously extended their networks and influence since the 1990s. Our analysis suggests that the contestation of liberalism is not reducible to political parties and instead should be approached as a broader phenomenon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Buzogány","given":"Aron"},{"family":"Varga","given":"Mihai"}],"citation-key":"buzoganyIdeationalFoundationsIlliberal2018","container-title":"Review of International Political Economy","DOI":"10.1080/09692290.2018.1543718","ISSN":"0969-2290","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,2]]},"page":"811-828","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The ideational foundations of the illiberal backlash in Central and Eastern Europe: the case of Hungary","title-short":"The ideational foundations of the illiberal backlash in Central and Eastern Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2018.1543718","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"carrubbaWhoControlsContent2012","abstract":"Conventional arguments identify either the median justice or the opinion author as the most influential justices in shaping the content of Supreme Court opinions. We develop a model of judicial decision making that suggests that opinions are likely to reflect the views of the median justice in the majority coalition. This result derives from two features of judicial decision making that have received little attention in previous models. The first is that in deciding a case, justices must resolve a concrete dispute, and that they may have preferences over which party wins the specific case confronting them. The second is that justices who are dissatisfied with an opinion are free to write concurrences (and dissents). We demonstrate that both features undermine the bargaining power of the Court's median and shift influence towards the coalition median. An empirical analysis of concurrence behavior provides significant support for the model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Carrubba","given":"Cliff"},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Vanberg","given":"Georg"}],"citation-key":"carrubbaWhoControlsContent2012","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00557.x","ISSN":"1540-5907","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"400-412","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Who Controls the Content of Supreme Court Opinions?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00557.x","volume":"56"},

The million-dollar question raised in current doctrinal work is the question of its limits. One such limit concerns the applicability of the doctrine to socioeconomic\nrights. Since the doctrine and case law of constitutional courts do not provide clear answers in this regard, the main goal of this paper is to assess whether proportionality is a suitable method to review interferences with socio-economic rights. First, the paper discusses the theoretical aspects of this issue, primarily the paradigmatic structure of constitutional\nreview. Second, the paper continues with a case study of the Czech Constitutional Court. In order to review interferences of these rights, the Constitutional Court applies the rationality test.

  {"id":"cervinekStandardyPrezkumuUstavnosti2015","abstract":"This paper analyzes the methodology of constitutional review used by the Czech Constitutional Court. This methodology is divided into three types of standards: the proportionality test, the extreme disproportionality exclusion test, and the rational basis test. These standards create a comprehensive three-component system of constitutional review tests, where individual tests or relations between them are not fully defined and stable. This system evolves on the contrary. We claim that the relations between these tests lack clear criteria to distinguish between extreme disproportionality exclusion test and rational basis test in the practice of the Constitutional Court. This leads to conclusion that they should be unified under one deferential standard of constitutional review.","author":[{"family":"Červinek","given":"Zdeněk"}],"citation-key":"cervinekStandardyPrezkumuUstavnosti2015","container-title":"Constitutional Review Standards in Practice of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic.

Tuto otázku nejprve zasazuje do kontextu obecné teorie senátního rozhodování a následně empiricky zkoumá v rozhodnutích Ústavního soudu. Na teoretické úrovni jsou formulovány tři základní účely senátního rozhodování: posílení legitimity rozhodnutí, eliminace chyb a dosažení promyšlenějšího rozhodnutí, a čtyři modely senátního rozhodování: konfliktní senát, strategický senát, kolegiální senát a formální senát. Objasněn je pojem a možné příčiny tzv. panelového efektu v senátním rozhodování. V rámci vlastního výzkumu je pak analyzováno, nakolik jsou uvedené funkce naplňovány v rozhodování Ústavního soudu, kterému z modelů se senáty Ústavního soudu nejvíce blíží a zda se v senátním rozhodování projevuje panelový efekt.

  {"id":"cisarPolanyiPoliticaleconomicOpportunity2017","abstract":"Drawing on Polanyian logic, we focus on the gradual institutionalization of capitalism in the Czech Republic and the protests accompanying this process. We hypothesize that different configurations of political economy, or what we term the political economic opportunity structure, trigger different popular responses and are a potent indicator of expected protest forms. To analyze this we chose to carry out a country case study, in which many variables commonly associated with political mobilization, in particular the state’s institutional structure, are kept constant. By contrast, models of political economy vary over time, as a function of the extent and form of the international integration of capitalism. We focus on three configurations of political economy – national, globalized and austerity models – and for each one, identify the characteristics and mechanisms, i.e. concrete policy measures, that shape particular protest patterns in the context of our case study. In theoretical terms, this paper seeks to present one possible response, in this case a Polanyian response, to recent complaints about the disappearance of capitalism from social movement studies. At the same time, given the focus of this special issue, our goal is to analyze the current wave of anti-austerity protest that emerged in relation to what has been labelled the Great Recession.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Císař","given":"Ondřej"},{"family":"Navrátil","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"cisarPolanyiPoliticaleconomicOpportunity2017","container-title":"Social Movement Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14742837.2016.1235497","ISSN":"1474-2837","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,2]]},"page":"82-100","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Polanyi, political-economic opportunity structure and protest: capitalism and contention in the post-communist Czech Republic","title-short":"Polanyi, political-economic opportunity structure and protest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2016.1235497","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"claesProtectionNationalConstitutional2015","abstract":"This contribution revisits the Bundesverfassungsgericht's order for reference in the Gauweiler case and focuses on two aspects of that order that until now have not received much scholarly attention. The first concerns the German federal constitutional court's dissociation of constitutional identity review under the German Basic Law from national identity review under Article 4(2) TEU. While the decision on the Lisbon Treaty had suggested that the two go “hand in hand”, the Bundesverfassungsgericht now emphasizes the “fundamental” difference between the concept of national identity under Article 4(2) TEU on the one hand and the German concept of constitutional identity on the other. The second element is the German federal constitutional court's contention that its approach to ultra vires and constitutional identity review can also be found in the constitutional law of many other member states. Yet, careful analysis demonstrates that while there does indeed seem to be a trend in that direction, and several elements of the German approach can also be found in other countries, very few national courts are as adamant as the Bundesverfassungsgericht, and only a handful have developed their position with the same level of detail and ardor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Claes","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Reestman","given":"Jan-Herman"}],"citation-key":"claesProtectionNationalConstitutional2015","container-title":"German Law Journal","DOI":"10.1017/S2071832200019957","ISSN":"2071-8322","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"917-970","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Protection of National Constitutional Identity and the Limits of European Integration at the Occasion of the Gauweiler Case","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/german-law-journal/article/protection-of-national-constitutional-identity-and-the-limits-of-european-integration-at-the-occasion-of-the-gauweiler-case/C14BF4E4BAB7EB89040236516FF10E23","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"clarkeConscientiousObjectionVaccination2017","abstract":"Vaccine refusal occurs for a variety of reasons. In this article we examine vaccine refusals that are made on conscientious grounds; that is, for religious, moral, or philosophical reasons. We focus on two questions: first, whether people should be entitled to conscientiously object to vaccination against contagious diseases (either for themselves or for their children); second, if so, to what constraints or requirements should conscientious objection (CO) to vaccination be subject. To address these questions, we consider an analogy between CO to vaccination and CO to military service. We argue that conscientious objectors to vaccination should make an appropriate contribution to society in lieu of being vaccinated. The contribution to be made will depend on the severity of the relevant disease(s), its morbidity, and also the likelihood that vaccine refusal will lead to harm. In particular, the contribution required will depend on whether the rate of CO in a given population threatens herd immunity to the disease in question: for severe or highly contagious diseases, if the population rate of CO becomes high enough to threaten herd immunity, the requirements for CO could become so onerous that CO, though in principle permissible, would be de facto impermissible.; © 2016 The Authors Bioethics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,26]]},"archive_location":"28008636","author":[{"family":"Clarke","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Giubilini","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Mary Jean"}],"citation-key":"clarkeConscientiousObjectionVaccination2017","container-title":"Bioethics","container-title-short":"Bioethics","DOI":"10.1111/bioe.12326","ISSN":"1467-8519","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"page":"155-161","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Conscientious Objection to Vaccination","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ezproxy.muni.cz/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,cookie,uid&db=mdc&AN=28008636&lang=cs&site=eds-live&scope=site","volume":"31"},

Citations from new opinions to precedent opinions usually apply and endorse the doctrine of the precedent opinion; however, sometimes they implicitly or explicitly dispute the precedent opinion. We collect original datasets classifying citations from search and seizure and freedom of religion opinions written between 1953 and 2006 into these different types and develop a model relating the similarity of the doctrine embodied in the citing and cited opinions to the relative probability of these different types of citations. The resulting spatial estimates of opinion location are used to evaluate theories of Supreme Court bargaining and opinion writing. We find empirical support for theoretical models that predict the majority opinion will fall at the ideal point of the median member of the majority coalition.

  {"id":"clootsNationalIdentityEU2015","abstract":"Despite nearly sixty years of European integration, neither nations nor national loyalties have withered away. On the contrary, national identity rhetoric seems on the rise, not only in politics but also in legal discourse. Lately we have seen a rise in the number of Member States invoking their national identity in an attempt to justify a derogation from a requirement imposed on them by a Treaty article or an EU legislative act, or to legitimize a particular national reading of such an EU norm. Despite this, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has yet to develop a coherent approach to such arguments, or express a vision of the role national identity should play in EU law. Elke Cloots undertakes this task by providing a principled and coherent scheme for the adjudication of disputes involving claims based on the national identity of a Member State. Should arguments involving national identity be legally relevant? If yes, how should the ECJ approach such identity-related interests? Cloots crafts a normative framework to assist the ECJ in striking the right balance between European integration and respect for the identity concerns at issue. The book combines rigorous theoretical inquiry with thorough analysis of the European Treaties and case law, with particular attention paid to litigation involving domestic measures concerning the national system of government, constitutional rights protections, and language policy. Clarifying the issues at stake and presenting a solution to these problems, this book will be an invaluable resource for the academics, lawyers, and policy makers in the field.","author":[{"family":"Cloots","given":"Elke"}],"citation-key":"clootsNationalIdentityEU2015","ISBN":"978-0-19-105350-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"449","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"National Identity in EU Law","type":"book"},
  {"id":"closaInstitutionalLogicsEU2020","abstract":"Several European Union (EU) governments have infringed the obligation to respect ‘rule of law’ as demanded by the European Union Treaty but, despite its supranational features, the EU has done little to sanction those violations. Why? The European Union’s institutional features paradoxically permit (and even encourage) logics that might be inhibiting its sanctioning capacity. Thus, a partisanship logic informs the European Parliament and this protects errant states. Then, the Commission, rather than acting assertively, anticipates the Council’s stance and adapts also its actions to anticipate a ‘compliance dilemma’ (i.e. compliance depends ultimately on the good will and cooperation of domestic authorities). The Commission prefers to channel its sanctioning activity via other softer instruments (e.g. infringement procedures). Finally, a distaste for increasing EU competence, ideological sympathy for illiberal governments, or fears of spillovers from sanctioning activity inform the action of governments within the Council. Those three institutional logics combine to explain the unexpectedly low sanctioning record for breaches of EU values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Closa","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"closaInstitutionalLogicsEU2020","container-title":"International Political Science Review","container-title-short":"International Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1177/0192512120908323","ISSN":"0192-5121","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,22]]},"language":"en","page":"0192512120908323","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Institutional logics and the EU’s limited sanctioning capacity under Article 7 TEU","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0192512120908323"},

This comparison of proportionality with its counterpart in American constitutional law - balancing - shows how culture and history can create deep differences in seemingly similar doctrines. Owing to its historical origin in Germany, proportionality carries to this day a pro-rights association, while the opposite is the case for balancing. In addition, European legal and political culture has shaped proportionality as intrinsic to the state's role in realizing shared values, while in the United States a suspicion-based legal and political culture has shaped balancing in more pragmatic and instrumental terms. Although many argue that the USA should converge on proportionality, the book shows that a complex web of cultural associations make it an unlikely prospect.","author":[{"family":"Cohen-Eliya","given":"Moshe"},{"family":"Porat","given":"Iddo"}],"citation-key":"cohen-eliyaProportionalityConstitutionalCulture2013","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-107-24475-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"183","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Google Books","title":"Proportionality and Constitutional Culture","type":"book"},

  {"id":"crossleyMovingClassicReadability2019","abstract":"Background Advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics have facilitated major improvements on traditional readability formulas that aim at predicting the overall difficulty of a text. Recent studies have identified several types of linguistic features that are theoretically motivated and predictive of human judgments of text readability, which outperform predictions made by traditional readability formulas, such as Flesch–Kincaid. The purpose of this study is to develop new readability models using advanced NLP tools to measure both text comprehension and reading speed. Methods This study used crowdsourcing techniques to collect human judgments of text comprehension and reading speed across a diverse variety of topic domains (science, technology and history). Linguistic features taken from state-of-the-art NLP tools were used to develop models explaining human judgments of text comprehension and reading speed. The accuracy of these models was then compared with classic readability formulas. Results The results indicated that models employing linguistic features more theoretically related to text comprehension and reading speed outperform classic readability models. Conclusions This study developed new readability formulas based on advanced NLP tools for both text comprehension and reading speed. These formulas, based on linguistic features that better represent theoretical and behavioural accounts of the reading process, significantly outperformed classic readability formulas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Crossley","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Skalicky","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Dascalu","given":"Mihai"}],"citation-key":"crossleyMovingClassicReadability2019","container-title":"Journal of Research in Reading","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9817.12283","ISSN":"1467-9817","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"541-561","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Moving beyond classic readability formulas: new methods and new models","title-short":"Moving beyond classic readability formulas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9817.12283","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"crossleyToolAutomaticAnalysis2019","abstract":"This article introduces the second version of the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion (TAACO 2.0). Like its predecessor, TAACO 2.0 is a freely available text analysis tool that works on the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems; is housed on a user’s hard drive; is easy to use; and allows for batch processing of text files. TAACO 2.0 includes all the original indices reported for TAACO 1.0, but it adds a number of new indices related to local and global cohesion at the semantic level, reported by latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, and word2vec. The tool also includes a source overlap feature, which calculates lexical and semantic overlap between a source and a response text (i.e., cohesion between the two texts based measures of text relatedness). In the first study in this article, we examined the effects that cohesion features, prompt, essay elaboration, and enhanced cohesion had on expert ratings of text coherence, finding that global semantic similarity as reported by word2vec was an important predictor of coherence ratings. A second study was conducted to examine the source and response indices. In this study we examined whether source overlap between the speaking samples found in the TOEFL-iBT integrated speaking tasks and the responses produced by test-takers was predictive of human ratings of speaking proficiency. The results indicated that the percentage of keywords found in both the source and response and the similarity between the source document and the response, as reported by word2vec, were significant predictors of speaking quality. Combined, these findings help validate the new indices reported for TAACO 2.0.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Crossley","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Kyle","given":"Kristopher"},{"family":"Dascalu","given":"Mihai"}],"citation-key":"crossleyToolAutomaticAnalysis2019","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-018-1142-4","ISSN":"1554-3528","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"14-27","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion 2.0: Integrating semantic similarity and text overlap","title-short":"The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion 2.0","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1142-4","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"dalyDemocraticDecayConceptualising2019","abstract":"In recent years the creeping deterioration of democratic rule worldwide has become a major preoccupation across a wide range of research fields and disciplines—especially public law and political science—as scholars struggle to understand the nature of evolving threats to a broad range of democratic systems. Many terms are now used to refer to the incremental degradation of democratic rule worldwide, or ‘democratic decay’. Abusive constitutionalism. Autocratic legalism. Populist constitutionalism. Bad faith constitutionalism. De-constitutionalism. Constitutional retrogression. Constitutional capture. Constitutional rot. Constitutional decay. Democratic deconsolidation. Democratic backsliding. Authoritarianisation. Authoritarian backsliding. Rule of law backsliding. Democratic erosion. Democratic recession. The list goes on. This article argues that conceiving of this scattered cross-disciplinary literature as a research field and providing an account of recent conceptual development can help to map a rapidly developing landscape, maximise the analytical utility of key concepts, identify resonances and duplication among concepts and across discrete literatures, and can help to ensure that this emerging quasi-field develops in a more coherent and rigorous manner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Daly","given":"Tom Gerald"}],"citation-key":"dalyDemocraticDecayConceptualising2019","container-title":"Hague Journal on the Rule of Law","container-title-short":"Hague J Rule Law","DOI":"10.1007/s40803-019-00086-2","ISSN":"1876-4053","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"9-36","source":"Springer Link","title":"Democratic Decay: Conceptualising an Emerging Research Field","title-short":"Democratic Decay","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40803-019-00086-2","volume":"11"},

Legal formalism holds that judges apply legal reasons to the facts of a case in a rational, mechanical, and deliberative manner. In contrast legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is \"what the judge ate for breakfast\" in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges' two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct \"decision sessions.\" We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break. Our findingssuggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Danziger","given":"Shai"},{"family":"Levav","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Avnaim-Pesso","given":"Liora"},{"family":"Kahneman","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"danzigerExtraneousFactorsJudicial2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"6889-6892","source":"JSTOR","title":"Extraneous factors in judicial decisions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41242099","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"dasilvaComparingIncommensurableConstitutional2011","abstract":"Balancing implies a comparison among goods, values, principles and rights that cannot be ranked on a single scale of measurement, ie there is no unequivocal measuring unit applicable to all of them. In such situations, it is common to state that one has to compare incommensurable things. Indeed, this issue has been mentioned by several authors as a strong reason in favour of abandoning balancing (and proportionality) as a rational form of judicial argumentation and decision-making. My article aims at arguing that this objection is based on fallacious assumptions concerning the relations among three concepts: incommensurability, incomparability and balancing. Initially, what is at stake is the analysis of the connection between comparing values (or principles) and commensurability. The results of this initial analysis were then used to provide greater analytical strength to the specific debate on balancing and comparing rights in order to show that incommensurability does not imply incomparability and that rational decisions are possible even when incommensurable values are at stake. Since balancing (and proportionality) implies comparisons, and since constitutional principles are doubtlessly incommensurable (for there is no common metric to measure them), arguing for the comparability of incommensurable principles is an unavoidable step if one aims at demonstrating that balancing may be a rational procedure after all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"V.

We show that the law generally ought to follow social norms or be stricter than them. When society is only concerned with the trade-off between deterrence and enforcement costs, legal standards defining offenses should align with underlying norms so long as the latter are not too deficient. When providing productive information to third parties is also a concern, legal standards should either align with underlying norms with fines that trade off deterrence against the provision of information; or legal standards should be more demanding and enforced with purely symbolic sanctions, for example, public reprimands.

Schools employing problem-based learning have always struggled to achieve congruence between their objectives and student achievement assessment. Reality has taught us that the ideals of problem-based and life-long learning are dif cult to translate into an assessment system. This paper is a case study of the development of an assessment program in a problem-based learning curriculum, its pitfalls, the compromises between the ideal and the attainable, and the way in which a number of solutions were eventually found. It demonstrates the power of student assessment. Our law faculty developed a new assessment system based on a range of assessment methods, such as block tests, portfolios and formative computer-based tests, whereby the assessment program was continuously monitored and evaluated. The assessment program enhanced skills and changed attitudes that had been opposed to the ideals of life-long and problem-based learning.

This is one, big thing that the hedgehog knows, in contrast to the fox, who knows many little things. Dworkin’s understanding of the relationship—between ethics, morality, and political morality—is significantly revised and also greatly elaborated. He argues that “dignity” is the essential core of living well and that a satisfactory account of dignity would, in turn, point to two principles. The first states that it is objectively important that each person’s life go well; and the second that each person has a special responsibility for identifying what counts as success in his or her own life. Dworkin believes that values cohere and that in order to defend that coherence he has to take up a broad variety of philosophical issues that are not normally treated in one book. He discusses the metaphysics of value, the character of truth, the nature of interpretation, the conditions of agreement and disagreement, the phenomenon of moral responsibility and the problem of free will as well as more substantive issues of ethical, moral and legal theory.","author":[{"family":"Dworkin","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"dworkinJusticeHedgehogs2011","event-place":"Harvard","ISBN":"978-0-674-07196-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"521","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Harvard","source":"Google Books","title":"Justice for Hedgehogs","type":"book"},

  {"id":"dyevreDomesticJudicialDefiance2016","abstract":"In a multi-level, non-hierarchical court system, where courts at the upper echelon do not have the power to reverse the decisions of courts at the lower level, judicial cooperation appears crucial to the effectiveness of the higher-level law. For this reason, recent decisions by national courts may seem to bode ill for the authority of EU law. In January 2012, the Czech Constitutional Court declared the decision of the Court of Justice in the Landtova´ case ultra vires. This came on the heels of other domestic rulings stressing the constitutional limits of integration. More recently, in February 2014, the German Federal Constitutional Court passed on its ﬁrst-ever case to the Court of Justice. But even the German Court’s reference may be viewed as escalating, rather than easing tensions with the European Court. Still, borrowing insights from game theory and international relations, the present article argues that, in the current conﬁguration of European integration, these developments do not pose an existential threat to the EU legal order. It demonstrates that many aspects of the jurisprudence of constitutional conﬂict can be captured by a simple Hawk–Dove game in which courts compete over a jurisdictional resource but face costs when the dispute escalates into a constitutional crisis. Extensions to the baseline model then help cast a wider light on the use and effectiveness of non-compliance threats by domestic high courts. The analysis suggests that actual instances of overt domestic non-compliance such as the Czech case are more likely to remain isolated accidents. Also, despite its judicial superpower status, the German Federal Constitutional Court has incentives to seek concessions from the Court of Justice through peaceful dialogue rather than through an all-out judicial war.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Dyevre","given":"Arthur"}],"citation-key":"dyevreDomesticJudicialDefiance2016","container-title":"Yearbook of European Law","container-title-short":"Yearbook of European Law","DOI":"10.1093/yel/yew001","ISSN":"0263-3264, 2045-0044","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"106-144","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Domestic Judicial Defiance in the European Union: A Systemic Threat to the Authority of EU Law?","title-short":"Domestic Judicial Defiance in the European Union","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/yel/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/yel/yew001","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"dyevreWhoRefersMost2020","abstract":"By enabling the Court of Justice to engage domestic judges, the preliminary ruling mechanism is widely recognised to have played a major role in European integration. Yet both the incentives and motivation to cooperate with the Court of Justice are believed to vary signiﬁcantly across domestic courts. We explore how domestic courts diﬀer in their referral behaviour depending on the position they occupy in the juridical hierarchy using a novel dataset, which extends, complements and corrects data initially collected by Stone Sweet and Brunell (1998. ‘The European Court and the national courts: a statistical analysis of preliminary references, 1961–95’, Journal of European Public Policy 5 (1): 66–97). We ﬁnd that ﬁrst instance courts pioneered the use of the preliminary ruling procedure, but that appellate and peak courts subsequently overtook them. We explain these shifts by the combined eﬀect of institutional consolidation, organisational design and legal rules. We argue that resort to Article 267 TFEU was initially ‘accidental’ but became institutionalised as more courts submitted references. This, in turn, allowed the division of labour underpinning the organisation of national judiciaries to reshape referral dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Dyevre","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Glavina","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Atanasova","given":"Angelina"}],"citation-key":"dyevreWhoRefersMost2020","container-title":"Journal of European Public Policy","container-title-short":"Journal of European Public Policy","DOI":"10.1080/13501763.2019.1629991","ISSN":"1350-1763, 1466-4429","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,2]]},"language":"en","number":"6","page":"912-930","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Who refers most?

  {"id":"dyzenhausPhilosophicalFoundationsConstitutional2016","abstract":"Constitutional law has been and remains an area of intense philosophical interest, and yet the debate has taken place in a variety of different fields with very little to connect them. In a collection of essays bringing together scholars from several constitutional systems and disciplines, Philosophical Foundations of Constitutional Law unites the debate in a study of the philosophical issues at the very foundations of the idea of a constitution: why one might be necessary; what problems it must address; what problems constitutions usually address; and some of the issues raised by the administration of a constitutional regime. Although these issues of institutional design are of abiding importance, many of them have taken on new significance in the last few years as law-makers have been forced to return to first principles in order to justify novel practices and arrangements in their constitutional orders. Thus, questions of constitutional 'revolutions', challenges to the demands of the rule of law, and the separation of powers have taken on new and pressing importance. The essays in this volume address these questions, filling the gap in the philosophical analysis of constitutional law. The volume will provoke specialists in philosophy, politics, and law to develop new philosophically grounded analyses of constitutional law, and will be a valuable resource for graduate students in law, politics, and philosophy.","author":[{"family":"Dyzenhaus","given":"David"},{"family":"Thorburn","given":"Malcolm"}],"citation-key":"dyzenhausPhilosophicalFoundationsConstitutional2016","event-place":"Oxford, United Kingdom","ISBN":"978-0-19-875452-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"00007","number-of-pages":"353","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, United Kingdom","source":"Google Books","title":"Philosophical Foundations of Constitutional Law","type":"book"},

  {"id":"ekiertDemocracyCentralEastern2013","abstract":"In the twenty years since communism’s collapse, scholars of postcommmunist Central and Eastern Europe have increasingly converged on the insight that long-run continuities reaching back to the nineteenth century are crucial in shaping some of the most important contemporary macro- and micro-level political outcomes in the region. Today’s political cleavages, political discourses, patterns of partisan affiliation, institutional choice, and the quality of democracy itself all appear to correlate to a remarkable degree with patterns from the “deep past.” To date, social scientists, however, have not sufficiently reflected on what might explain this finding and how to study the impact of the general phenomenon of the long-run in the region. This article makes two contributions. First, we contend that in general, long-run continuities may ironically be more important in contexts of discontinuous institutional change such as in Central and Eastern Europe since frequent institutional disjunctures paradoxically open chasms between formal and informal institutions, preventing gradual change and producing patterns of institutional mimicry to cope with institutional ruptures. This insight may travel to other contexts of weak institutionalization. Second, we reject efforts to identify “deep causes” of contemporary outcomes without specifying how intervening events and crises intersect with these longer-run patterns. The article resuscitates Fernand Braudel’s notion of the longue duree to propose a new cumulative approach to the study of the long-run that complicates accounts that too starkly juxtapose precommunist and communist-era “legacies” on the present and argues that scholars should study how these periods reinforce each other and jointly determine contemporary outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Ekiert","given":"Grzegorz"},{"family":"Ziblatt","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"ekiertDemocracyCentralEastern2013","container-title":"East European Politics and Societies","container-title-short":"East European Politics and Societies","DOI":"10.1177/0888325412465310","ISSN":"0888-3254","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"90-107","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe One Hundred Years On","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0888325412465310","volume":"27"},

Variants of the social-psychological paradigm, which have long dominated thinking about law and courts, are giving way to approaches grounded in assumptions in rationality. More to the point, ever-growing numbers of scholars are now invoking the strategic account to understand judicial politics. In what follows, we investigate this “strategic revolution.” We begin by providing an intellectual history of the field, with special emphasis on why judicial specialists resisted strategic analysis for so long and why they are now (re)turning to it in ever-increasing numbers. Next, we consider the ways that analysts have begun to put the strategic account to work. This is an important task, for debates are already emerging over the “best” way to invoke the account to study judicial politics. We take the position that there is no one “right” way but rather four different approaches-all of which have the potential to provide us with important insights into law and courts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Knight","given":"Jack"}],"citation-key":"epsteinStrategicRevolutionJudicial2000","container-title":"Political Research Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/106591290005300309","ISSN":"1065-9129","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"625-661","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Toward a Strategic Revolution in Judicial Politics: A Look Back, A Look Ahead","title-short":"Toward a Strategic Revolution in Judicial Politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/106591290005300309","volume":"53"},

We examine dissent aversion using data from both the federal courts of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. Our empirical findings are consistent with the predictions of the model. In the court of appeals, the frequency of dissents is negatively related to the caseload and positively related to ideological diversity among judges in the circuit and circuit size (i.e., the fewer the judges, the greater the collegiality costs of dissenting and therefore, other things being equal, the fewer dissents). We also find that dissents increase the length of majority opinions (imposing collegiality costs by making the majority work harder) and are rarely cited either inside or outside the circuit (reducing the value of dissenting to dissenters). In the Supreme Court, we find that the dissent rate is negatively related to the caseload and positively related to ideological differences, that majority opinions are longer when there is a dissent, and that dissents are rarely cited in either the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Landes","given":"William M."},{"family":"Posner","given":"Richard A."}],"citation-key":"epsteinWhyWhenJudges2011","container-title":"Journal of Legal Analysis","container-title-short":"Journal of Legal Analysis","DOI":"10.1093/jla/3.1.101","ISSN":"2161-7201","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,1]]},"page":"101-137","source":"Silverchair","title":"Why (And When) Judges Dissent: A Theoretical And Empirical Analysis","title-short":"Why (And When) Judges Dissent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jla/3.1.101","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"fabryPoliticalEconomyHungary2019","abstract":"This book explores the political economy of Hungary from the mid-1970s to the present. Widely considered a ‘poster boy’ of neoliberal transformation in post-communist Eastern Europe until the mid-2000s, Hungary has in recent years developed into a model ‘illiberal’ regime. Constitutional checks-and-balances are non-functioning; the independent media, trade unions, and civil society groups are constantly attacked by the authorities; there is widespread intolerance against minorities and refugees; and the governing FIDESZ party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, controls all public institutions and increasingly large parts of the country’s economy. To make sense of the politico-economical roller coaster that Hungary has experienced in the last four decades, Fabry employs a Marxian political economy approach, emphasising competitive accumulation, class struggle (both between capital and labour, as well as different ‘fractions of capital’), and uneven and combined development. The author analyses the neoliberal transformation of the Hungarian political economy and argues that the drift to authoritarianism under the Orbán regime cannot be explained as a case of Hungarian exceptionalism, but rather represents an outcome of the inherent contradictions of the variety of neoliberalism that emerged in Hungary after 1989.","author":[{"family":"Fabry","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"fabryPoliticalEconomyHungary2019","ISBN":"978-3-030-10594-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"178","publisher":"Springer","source":"Google Books","title":"The Political Economy of Hungary: From State Capitalism to Authoritarian Neoliberalism","title-short":"The Political Economy of Hungary","type":"book"},

Painstakingly traveling through Marx’s oeuvre, Fromm shows how Marx’s real goal was to eliminate man’s alienation, and allow individuals to live and appreciate a life of freedom. Furthermore, Fromm believes, Marx would have considered the Communist governments of Russia and Cuba as wrong-headed. Marx’s Concept of Man also includes a selection of Marx’s Early Writings, brought to English-speaking readers for the first time in 1961. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Erich Fromm, with rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author’s estate.","author":[{"family":"Fromm","given":"Erich"}],"citation-key":"frommMarxConceptMan2013","ISBN":"978-1-4804-0209-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,26]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"355","publisher":"Open Road Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Marx's Concept of Man","type":"book"},

  {"id":"fullerMoralityLaw1969","abstract":"In a lengthy new concluding chapter labeled \"A Reply to Critics,\" Lon L. Fuller extends and clarifies his definition of the relation between law and morality put forward in the first (1964) edition of The Morality of Law. His original argument distinguishes between the morality of duty and the morality of aspiration, both of which bear on the design and operation of social institutions: the former by setting the necessary preconditions of any purposive social endeavor, the latter by suggesting the directions for such endeavor. In the revised edition, Fuller takes accurate aim at the school of legal philosophy called the New Analytical Jurists and continues his long-running debate with his major intellectual antagonist, H.L.A. Hart. Although the author calls the new chapter \"A Reply to Critics,\" his expressed reason for undertaking it indicates that it is more than that: \"As critical reviews of my book came in, I myself became increasingly aware of the extent to which the debate did indeed depend on ''starting points'' - not on what the disputants said, but on what they considered it unnecessary to say, not on articulated principles but on tacit assumptions. What was needed, therefore, it seemed to me, was to bring these tacit assumptions to more adequate expression than either side has so far been able to do.\" There is no question that Mr. Fuller here gives the assumptions of his side adequate expression. \"The volume must be regarded as an important contribution of general interest to the study of the nature and function of law...Trenchant comment abounds throughout the book, and there is an immense amount of the most valuable material here, as well as considerable food for the thought...his book deserves to reach a very wide audience.\" - Law Times.  \"The book is a provocative one which is certain to excite much academic comment here and abroad.\" - Harvard Law Record.  \"Although fully intelligible to the undergraduate, this book is likely to receive its warmest reception form advanced students of the philosophy of law, who will welcome the relief provided from the frequently sterile tone of much recent work in the field.\" - Choice","author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"Lon L."}],"citation-key":"fullerMoralityLaw1969","ISBN":"978-0-300-01070-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1969]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"272","publisher":"Yale University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Morality of Law","type":"book"},

When fundamental rights are at stake, three assumptions are challenged: the determination of direct effect shall be a prerogative of the ECJ; EU directly effective provisions entail the disapplication of conflicting national law; judges have the discretion to refer preliminary references to the ECJ where a clarification on EU law is needed. The contribution argues that the judicial search for a balance between sovereignty and supranationality is undermined by the ICC's new resistance to the well-established EU jurisprudence. In that respect, the paper posits that the ICC's activism is the result of an unjustified ?argumentative self-restraint? of the ECJ vis-à-vis the evolution of EU foundational principles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallo","given":"Daniele"}],"citation-key":"galloChallengingEUConstitutional2019","container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/eulj.12333","ISSN":"1351-5993","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"number":"4","page":"434-456","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk (Atypon)","title":"Challenging EU constitutional law: The Italian Constitutional Court's new stance on direct effect and the preliminary reference procedure","title-short":"Challenging EU constitutional law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2152/doi/full/10.1111/eulj.12333","volume":"25"},

The proposed Regulation establishes a link between a Member State’s violation of the rule of law and the suspension of EU payments. The text examines the effects of the connection between the rule of law and EU money, both for the erring Member State and for the EU as a whole. The discussion shows that, despite the fact that the EU- level approach to the rule of law has significant benefits, it, at the same time, creates new risks. It may undermine the balance of powers in the EU by expanding the political and economic power of certain Member States over others, the power of EU institutions over Member States, and the power of the European Commission over other EU institutions. It is also questionable whether there is a sufficiently strong causal relation between the rule of law deficiency and threats to the EU’s financial interests. Most importantly, it is uncertain to what extent the rule of law conditionality will lead to the true transformation of negative, anti-rule-of-law trends in some Member States, which raises the question of whether the Rule of Law Proposal is capable of responding to the current challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldner Lang","given":"Iris"}],"citation-key":"goldnerlangRuleLawForce2020","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,28]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3545940","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"The Rule of Law, the Force of Law and the Power of Money in the EU","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3545940"},

  {"id":"grayPostCommunismCivilSociety1993","abstract":"For virtually all the major schools of Western opinion, the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, between 1989 and 1991, represents a triumph of Western values, ideas, and institutions. If, for triumphal conservatives, the events of late 1989 encompassed an endorsement of “democratic capitalism” that augured “the end of history,” for liberal and social democrats they could be understood as the repudiation by the peoples of the former Soviet bloc of Marxism-Leninism in all its varieties, and the reemergence of a humanist socialism that was free of Bolshevik deformation. The structure of political and economic institutions appropriate to the transition from post-Communism in the Soviet bloc to genuine civil society was, accordingly, modeled on Western exemplars—the example of Anglo-American democratic capitalism, of Swedish social democracy, or of the German social market economy— or on various modish Western academic conceptions, long abandoned in the Soviet and post-Soviet worlds, such as market socialism. No prominent school of thought in the West doubted that the dissolution of Communist power was part of a process of Westernization in which contemporary Western ideas and institutions could and would successfully be exported to the former Communist societies. None questioned the idea that, somewhere in the repertoire of Western theory and practice, there was a model for conducting the transition from the bankrupt institutions of socialist central planning, incorporated into the structure of a totalitarian state, to market institutions and a liberal democratic state. Least of all did anyone question the desirability, or the possibility, of reconstituting economic and political institutions on Western models, in most parts of the former Soviet bloc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"grayPostCommunismCivilSociety1993","container-title":"Social Philosophy and Policy","DOI":"10.1017/S026505250000412X","ISSN":"1471-6437, 0265-0525","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"1993/ed"},"language":"en","page":"26-50","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"From Post-Communism to Civil Society: The Reemergence of History and the Decline of the Western Model","title-short":"From Post-Communism to Civil Society","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-philosophy-and-policy/article/abs/from-postcommunism-to-civil-society-the-reemergence-of-history-and-the-decline-of-the-western-model/99A527FDB75752EF1E6EF4D0AEB97606","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"greskovitsHollowingBackslidingDemocracy2015","abstract":"The essay identifies two main dangers to East Central Europe's young democracies: ‘hollowing,’ or declining popular involvement in democracy, and ‘backsliding,’ or destabilization and reverting to semi-authoritarian practices. It traces the malaise of some but not all postsocialist democracies to varied combinations of hollowing and backsliding. The main finding is an intricate pattern: in some cases the two syndromes coincide, in others they do not. There is also significant cross-country variation in the gravity of syndromes. The region's pure neoliberal capitalist regimes are likelier to undermine popular political participation than those, which try to balance marketization with relatively generous social protection for its losers. At the same time, the article finds that while the hollowing of democracy before the global financial crisis has not necessarily been a curse, the massive participation of citizenry prior to the crisis has not been a generalized blessing from the viewpoint of democracy's resilience. This is substantiated by a comparative case study of Hungary and Latvia with lessons for activists of democracy promotion and civil society development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Greskovits","given":"Béla"}],"citation-key":"greskovitsHollowingBackslidingDemocracy2015","container-title":"Global Policy","DOI":"10.1111/1758-5899.12225","ISSN":"1758-5899","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"28-37","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Hollowing and Backsliding of Democracy in East Central Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1758-5899.12225","volume":"6"},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimmer","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."}],"citation-key":"grimmerTextDataPromise2013","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit. anal.","DOI":"10.1093/pan/mps028","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"267-297","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Text as Data: The Promise and Pitfalls of Automatic Content Analysis Methods for Political Texts","title-short":"Text as Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1047198700013401/type/journal_article","volume":"21"},

However, how does one guarantee rule of law? This paper uses the idea of ‘self-reinforcing’ institutions to show how political institutions may derail rule of law if associated judicial institutions are not self-reinforcing. We illustrate this using the contrasting examples of Estonia and Poland to frame the importance of institutional context in determining both rule of law and the path of legal institutions. Although starting\n              tabula rasa\n              for a legal system is difficult, it worked well for rule of law in Estonia in the post-communist transition. Alternately, Poland pursued a much more gradualist strategy of reform of formal legal institutions; this approach meant that justice institutions, slow to shed their legacy and connection with the past, were relatively weak and susceptible to attack from more powerful (political) ones.

  {"id":"haverkateMandatoryRecommendedVaccination2012","abstract":"This report provides an updated overview of recommended and mandatory vaccinations in the European Union (EU), Iceland and Norway, considering the differences in vaccine programme implementation between countries. In 2010, the Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort (VENICE) network, conducted a survey among the VENICE project gatekeepers to learn more about how national vaccination programmes are implemented, whether recommended or mandatory. Information was collected from all 27 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. In total 15 countries do not have any mandatory vaccinations; the remaining 14 have at least one mandatory vaccination included in their programme. Vaccination against polio is mandatory for both children and adults in 12 countries; diphtheria and tetanus vaccination in 11 countries and hepatitis B vaccination in 10 countries. For eight of the 15 vaccines considered, some countries have a mixed strategy of recommended and mandatory vaccinations. Mandatory vaccination may be considered as a way of improving compliance to vaccination programmes. However, compliance with many programmes in Europe is high, using only recommendations. More information about the diversity in vaccine offer at European level may help countries to adapt vaccination strategies based on the experience of other countries. However, any proposal on vaccine strategies should be developed taking into consideration the local context habits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Haverkate","given":"M."},{"family":"D’Ancona","given":"F."},{"family":"Giambi","given":"C."},{"family":"Johansen","given":"K."},{"family":"Lopalco","given":"P.

Five methods were employed to estimate injections per syringe made by exchange clients in four cities. In San Francisco, Chicago, and Baltimore, self-reported data on the number of injections per syringe were obtained. In New Haven, self-reported injection frequencies were combined with syringe tracking data to derive two methods for estimating the mean injections per syringe. The average number of injections per syringe declined by at least half after establishment of SEPs in New Haven, Baltimore, and Chicago, all cities where such an analysis could be made. There were significant increases in the percentages of exchangers reporting once-only use of their syringes in San Francisco, Baltimore, and Chicago, all cities where the data were amenable to this form of analysis. Self-report and syringe tracking estimates were in agreement that SEP participation was associated with decreases in syringe reuse by drug injectors. SEP participation was associated with increases in the once-only use of syringes. These findings add to earlier studies supporting the role of SEPs in reducing the transmission of syringe-borne infections such as HIV and hepatitis.","author":[{"family":"Heimer","given":"R."},{"family":"Khoshnood","given":"K."},{"family":"Bigg","given":"D."},{"family":"Guydish","given":"J."},{"family":"Junge","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"heimerSyringeUseReuse1998","container-title":"Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology: Official Publication of the International Retrovirology Association","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"hertoghWhatNonStateLaw2007","abstract":"In recent years, the number of references to \"non-state law\" has increased dramatically. Most of these publications, however, on subjects ranging from customary law and indigenous rights to the rules of the world-wide-web, struggle with the same fundamental question: What is non-state law? Because most of this literature has a strong normative focus, important conceptual and empirical questions are left unanswered. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap. It is not a critique of the previous work by lawyers, social scientists and legal theorists. Neither does this paper set out its own theory of non-state law. Instead, its goal is more modest: to review the socio-legal literature on non-state law and to draw a tentative conceptual map of this \"other hemisphere of the legal world\". The first half of this paper discusses three waves of attention for non-state law in the socio-legal literature: \"colonialism\", \"legal pluralism at home\" and \"globalization\". In the second half, this literature is used to draw a conceptual map of non-state law. One dimension of this map differentiates between non-state law within and without the national state. The other dimension differentiates between non-state law as rules of conduct and as norms for decision. In this way, our map locates four different types of non-state law. Writing in the early twentieth century, Eugen Ehrlich argued that the legal scholars of his day seriously impoverished the science of law because they confined their attention to the national state. Today, in the rapidly changing \"Global Bukowina\" of the twenty-first century, Ehrlich's plea for a decoupling of law from the state has still lost little of its relevance and a \"liberation from these shackles\" seems more appropriate than ever.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hertogh","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"hertoghWhatNonStateLaw2007","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.1008451","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,7,1]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 1008451","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"What is Non-State Law?

The recent publications of Best Practices for Legal Education and Educating Lawyers have reminded us that law teachers are shouldered with a task that extends beyond bar passage, duties that are felt beyond the teacher’s own knowledge, and privileges that cannot be enjoyed in isolation, with paper and pen, in the law professor’s office. Law teaching practices should focus on effective learning, and so the call has been made to reassess our teaching practices. As we launch into this noteworthy project, one identifiable challenge seems to be left largely (even if intentionally) unaddressed: in both Best Practices and Educating Lawyers, an emphasis has been placed on clinical programs and other mechanisms of experiential learning, perhaps overshadowing the attention that might be given to appropriate design considerations in doctrinal course offerings.

  {"id":"hirschlJudicializationPolitics2011","abstract":"The judicialization of politics—the reliance on courts and judicial means for addressing core moral predicaments, public policy questions, and political controversies—is arguably one of the most significant phenomena of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century government. Armed with newly acquired judicial review procedures, national high courts worldwide have been frequently asked to resolve a range of issues from the scope of expression and religious liberties and privacy to property, trade and commerce, education, immigration, labor, and environmental protection. This article analyzes the scope, nature, and causes of the judicialization of politics, as well as judicial behavior, recent jurisprudence of courts and tribunals worldwide, and the judicialization of “mega-politics” or “pure” politics—the transfer to courts of contentious issues of an outright political nature and significance. Questions of pure politics include electoral processes and outcomes, restorative justice, regime legitimacy, executive prerogatives, collective identity, and nation building. These developments reflect the demise of the “political question” doctrine, and mark a transition to what is termed “juristocracy.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirschl","given":"Ran"}],"citation-key":"hirschlJudicializationPolitics2011","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Political Science","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,7]]},"language":"en","source":"www.oxfordhandbooks.com","title":"The Judicialization of Politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199604456.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199604456-e-013"},
  {"id":"hirschlPoliticalOriginsJudicial2000","abstract":"Drawing upon an analysis of the political vectors behind constitutional reform in Israel (1992), Canada (1982), New Zealand (1990), and South Africa (1993), the article suggests that the trend toward constitutionalization in culturally divided polities has not been adequately delineated by extant theories of constitutional transformation. An examination of the political origins of these four constitutional revolutions suggests that judicial empowerment is in many cases the consequence of a conscious strategy undertaken by threatened political and economic elites seeking to preserve their hegemony vis-a-vis the growing influence of \"peripheral\" groups in crucial majoritarian policymaking arenas. In response to perceived threats by peripheral groups, elites who possess disproportionate access to and influence upon the legal arena often initiate a constitutional entrenchment of rights in order to insulate policymaking from popular political pressure. Power is transferred from majoritarian decision-making arenas to national high courts, where they assume their policy preferences will find greater support. This process of conscious judicial empowerment is likely to occur (a) when the judiciary's public reputation for political impartiality and rectitude is relatively high and (b) when the courts are likely to rule, by and large, in accordance with the cultural propensities and policy preferences of the traditionally hegemonic elites. Under such conditions, increasing judicial intrusion into the prerogatives of the legislature and the executive through the constitutionalization of rights and the establishment of judicial review may provide an efficient short-term institutional solution for ruling elites, who given an erosion in their popular support, may find strategic drawbacks in adhering to majoritarian decision-making processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,18]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Hirschl","given":"Ran"}],"citation-key":"hirschlPoliticalOriginsJudicial2000","container-title":"Law & Social Inquiry","ISSN":"0897-6546","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"number":"1","page":"91-149","publisher":"[American Bar Foundation, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Political Origins of Judicial Empowerment Through Constitutionalization: Lessons from Four Constitutional Revolutions","title-short":"The Political Origins of Judicial Empowerment Through Constitutionalization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/829019","volume":"25"},

Drawing on a sample of 1,300 national court decisions on EU directives with variation in Article 267 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) submissions, this article finds that disputes relating to directives leaving more room for manoeuvre in implementation (‘delegation’) and relating to more complex regulatory issues (‘information intensity’) are more likely to be referred to the ECJ for interpretation.

While successful in articulating and disseminating an effective global public policy, rule of law promotion has largely failed in its stated objectives of raising countries out of poverty and taming violent conflict. Furthermore, in its execution, this work deviates sharply from 'the rule of law' as commonly conceived. To explain this, Stephen Humphreys draws on the history of the rule of law as a concept, examples of legal export during colonial times, and a spectrum of contemporary interventions by development agencies and international organisations.

  {"id":"johnsonBayesRulesIntroduction2022","abstract":"An engaging, sophisticated, and fun introduction to the field of Bayesian statistics, Bayes Rules!: An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling brings the power of modern Bayesian thinking, modeling, and computing to a broad audience. In particular, the book is an ideal resource for advanced undergraduate statistics students and practitioners with comparable experience. the book assumes that readers are familiar with the content covered in a typical undergraduate-level introductory statistics course. Readers will also, ideally, have some experience with undergraduate-level probability, calculus, and the R statistical software. Readers without this background will still be able to follow along so long as theyare eager to pick up these tools on the fly as all R code is provided.Bayes Rules! empowers readers to weave Bayesian approaches into their everyday practice. Discussions and applications are data driven. A natural progression from fundamental to multivariable, hierarchical models emphasizes a practical and generalizable model building process. The evaluation of these Bayesian models reflects the fact that a data analysis does not exist in a vacuum.

It argues, further, that these dual dimensions of the separation of powers—division of labour and checks and balances—are both underpinned by the value of coordinated institutional effort in the service of good government.

EU member states have committed themselves to uphold the rule of law and to respect the primacy of EU law. Yet today, the EU legal order is threatened by the emergence of increasingly autocratic member state governments, particularly those in Hungary and Poland, who routinely violate the fundamental rule of law principles on which the EU is based. This article assesses whether the model of differentiated integration can be applied to help the EU address this rule of law crisis. In recent years, many analysts have called on the EU to embrace a model of differentiated integration as a way to address its many challenges, and some have suggested that versions of differentiation might help the EU resolve tensions with its member states concerning the rule of law. By contrast, this article will argue that differentiation in the rule of law and the theory of constitutional pluralism that some use to justify it are neither normatively desirable nor practically feasible models. In short, we must reject differentiated integration when it comes to rule of law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelemen","given":"R.

The EU has become trapped in an ‘authoritarian equilibrium’ underpinned by three factors. First, the EU's half-baked system of party politics and its ingrained reluctance to interfere in the domestic politics of its member states help shield national autocrats from EU intervention. Second, funding and investment from the EU helps sustain these regimes. Third, the free movement of persons in the EU facilitates the exit of dissatisfied citizens, which depletes the opposition and generates remittances, thereby helping these regimes endure. While more fully developed democratic federations have the capacity to eventually steer autocratic member states back toward democracy, the EU appears to be stuck in an autocracy trap.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelemen","given":"R.

This book presents an argument for why, under the right conditions, doing so can be a good way to advance social justice. In making such a case, the author considers the nature of the social minimum, the role of courts among other institutions, the empirical record of judicial impact, and the role of constitutional text. He argues, however, that when enforcing such rights, judges ought to adopt a theory of judicial restraint structured around four principles: democratic legitimacy, polycentricity, expertise and flexibility. These four principles, when taken collectively, commend an incrementalist approach to adjudication. The book combines theoretical, doctrinal, empirical and comparative analysis, and is written to be accessible to lawyers, social scientists, political theorists and human rights advocates.","author":[{"family":"King","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"kingJudgingSocialRights2012","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-107-00802-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,10]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"399","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Google Books","title":"Judging Social Rights","type":"book"},

  {"id":"kirstePhilosophicalFoundationsPrinciple2014","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to establish freedom as an embracing concept of the legal state and the rule of law. At times, especially by positivist scholars on the continent and i.e. Dicey in England, ‘legal state’ and ‘rule of law’ have been interpreted as seemingly antagonistic conceptions. If a broader concept of law is applied, the opposition between the two principles can be overcome. From this philosophical point of view they can be understood as two formulations of a common goal, distinct in some results and institutional settings, but united in a core value. For this purpose I understand law as a system of norms the enactment and enforcement of which is organized by procedures, which are themselves subject to norms. Because of this structure, law addresses freedom and is at the same time an expression of freedom. As a norm, law addresses freedom by directing the choice between alternative actions; these norms open and limit areas for the enactment, adjudication and enforcement of norms and actions. Accordingly, the principle of the legal state and the rule of law base public authority on legal freedom. Both principles can thereby be intrinsically connected to democracy. Against the narrative of antagonistic principles, my article will sketch how the development of the concept of the legal state is heavily indebted to the rule of law and has only towards the end of the nineteenth century gone a separate path.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirste","given":"Stephan"}],"citation-key":"kirstePhilosophicalFoundationsPrinciple2014","collection-title":"Ius Gentium: Comparative Perspectives on Law and Justice","container-title":"The Legal Doctrines of the Rule of Law and the Legal State (Rechtsstaat)","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-05585-5_3","editor":[{"family":"Silkenat","given":"James R."},{"family":"Hickey Jr.","given":"James E."},{"family":"Barenboim","given":"Peter D."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-05585-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"29-43","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Philosophical Foundations of the Principle of the Legal State (Rechtsstaat) and the Rule of Law","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-05585-5_3"},

  {"id":"kochenovBitingIntergovernmentalismCase2015","abstract":"In this largely instrumental thought experiment I make the case for exploring the potential of Article 259 TFEU, allowing for direct actions brought by the Member States of the European Union against other Member States in the context of the enforcement of the Rule of Law in the Member States deviating from the principles of Article 2 TEU. Deploying this proposal will imply changing the established practice of (non-)application of Article 259 TFEU. Such a change, while not departing from the letter or the spirit of the law, has several advantages, from not getting the Commission directly involved in the action about the values of Article 2 TEU (should it wish to keep on staying away), to avoiding the unhelpful construction of Article 258 TFEU, which has been interpreted too cautiously and emerged as unhelpful in the context of Rule of Law enforcement and entirely unused in the context of the Charter of Fundamental Rights violations. Change should start somewhere and the Member States, using Article 259 TFEU potentially could take the lead. In making the plea for paying more attention to horizontal enforcement of values among the Member States (albeit via the Court of Justice) this contribution draws on the helpful analysis of the possibility of bundling evidence of Member State disregard of the Rule of Law to start ‘systemic infringement actions’ before the Court of Justice. This technique, proposed by Kim Lane Scheppele, could make a difference in the world of enforcement of the promise of compliance with the very basics contained in Article 2 TEU.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kochenov","given":"Dimitry"}],"citation-key":"kochenovBitingIntergovernmentalismCase2015","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,11]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2672492","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Biting Intergovernmentalism: The Case for the Reinvention of Article 259 TFEU to Make It a Viable Rule of Law Enforcement Tool","title-short":"Biting Intergovernmentalism","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2672492"},

  {"id":"kochenovIndependenceLawfulComposition2020","abstract":"A short few days in September 2020 saw an extraordinary turn of events. The Member States of the European Union used the withdrawal of a Member State from the European Union (EU) as a pretext to dismiss a sitting Advocate General (AG) of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) before the expiration of the duration of her mandate provided for in primary law. The Member States replaced her with another nominee in the absence of a vacancy. This occurred in direct violation of EU primary law, including the cardinal principles of security of tenure and judicial independence. The CJEU had the opportunity to prevent this from occurring; yet did absolutely nothing to prevent it. Instead, the CJEU went out of its way to facilitate the appointment of Mr. Athanasios Rantos in place of AG Eleanor Sharpston. The drama in Three Acts, involving numerous elements – hints of lawlessness; signs of complicity between the Member States and the CJEU; confirmation of the lack of structural independence of the CJEU – has ultimately raised doubts whether the CJEU is legally composed. These September 2020 developments resulted in the dismissal of a member of the Court that the Member States did not want, no matter what the law said. In this article, these cumulative events are analyzed systematically through a legal lens, regrettably confirming a startling omission in the EU legal order – that the EU lacks a structurally independent court of law sitting at its apex, and that the EU legal system is not immune to ultra vires Member State interventions. Notwithstanding these developments and a severe pounding to the credibility of the CJEU, there remains a possibility for this deficiency in the EU legal order to be rectified.

  {"id":"kochenovRuleLawTool","abstract":"In this contribution, which embraces a dialogical understanding of the Rule of Law, I focus on the ‘other’ side of the Rule of Law coin in Europe, as opposed to the story of the fight for the values of Article 2 TEU: the deployment of the principle of the Rule of Law by the Court of Justice to pre-empt the necessary dialogue and to disqualify substantive arguments of principle originating in other legal orders. The Rule of Law, on this count and as used by the Court, emerges as a dangerous trump card making impossible the dialogue on which the Rule of Law directly depends.

  {"id":"kopaAlgorithmMarginAppreciation2014","abstract":"European Court of Human Rights applies the margin of appreciation doctrine in order to determine the level of its self-restraint and the latitude of free discretion of states when implementing their Convention obligations. The rationale behind this doctrine is that in certain cases, domestic bodies are in a better position than international judges to provide adequate protection to human rights. In this regard, they should be afforded a margin of appreciation. The Court subsequently only reviews, if the interferences contested by an individual fall within this margin or not. This doctrine was a subject of overwhelming critique because the European Court of Human Rights did not apply it transparently and consistently. Therefore the main goal of this article is to normatively construe an algorithm which could be taken into account by the European Court of Human Rights when applying the doctrine in order to prevent the mentioned critique.","author":[{"family":"Kopa","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"kopaAlgorithmMarginAppreciation2014","container-title":"International and Comparative Law Review","container-title-short":"International and Comparative Law Review","ISSN":"12138770","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"2014/06/01/Number 1/June 2014"},"page":"37","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"The Algorithm of the Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in Light of the Protocol No. 15 Amending the European Convention on Human Rights","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"kosarCourtPresidentsMissing2018","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to provide a new comprehensive understanding of roles of court presidents in judicial governance in Europe. It argues that in order to better understand the role of court presidents in comparative perspective it is necessary to unpack their power into smaller components that can be analyzed separately. We define seven such components: judicial career, jurisprudential, administrative, financial, ambassadorial, and media power, and ancillary powers as a residual category. Subsequently, we zero in on 13 European jurisdictions and rate them according to the strength of their court presidents’ powers. By doing so we are developing a Court President Power Index. Based on this Index we question the claim that Western court presidents are always weaker than their Eastern European counterparts and argue that powers of court presidents diverge both within Western Europe and within Eastern Europe, and hence it is difficult to draw the easy line along the West/East axis on this ground. Finally, we problematize our Court President Power Index and show that powers in the meaning of faculty do not necessarily translate into influence since various contingent circumstances (such as the length of court presidents’ terms of office, information asymmetry, the structure of the judiciary, the existence of competing judicial self governance bodies, the role of individuals, the proximity of court presidents to political leaders, the legal profession, legal culture, and the political environment) affect to what extent court presidents may exploit their powers in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kosař","given":"David"},{"family":"Blisa","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"kosarCourtPresidentsMissing2018","container-title":"German Law Journal","ISSN":"2071-8322","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","note":"00003","publisher":"Goethe University Frankfurt","source":"is.muni.cz","title":"Court Presidents: The Missing Piece in the Puzzle of Judicial Governance","title-short":"Court Presidents","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://is.muni.cz/publication/1479897/en/Court-Presidents-The-Missing-Piece-in-the-Puzzle-of-Judicial-Governance/Kosar-Blisa"},
  {"id":"kosarDomesticJudicialTreatment2020","abstract":"The European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) suffers from the burgeoning caseload and challenges to its authority. This two-pronged crisis undermines the ECtHR’s legitimacy and consequently the functioning of the whole European human rights regime. Domestic courts can serve as welcome allies of the Strasbourg Court. They have a potential to diffuse Convention norms domestically, and therefore prevent and filter many potential human rights violations. Yet, we know very little about how domestic courts actually treat the Strasbourg Court’s rulings. This book brings unique empirical findings on how often, how and with what consequences domestic judges work with the ECtHR’s case law. It moves beyond the narrow concept of compliance and develops a new three-level methodology for analysing the role played by domestic courts in the implementation of ECtHR case law. Moreover, using the example of Czechia, it shifts the attention from Western countries to a more volatile Central and Eastern European region, which has recently witnessed democratic backsliding and backlash against international checks on human rights and the rule of law standards. Looking at a wider social and legal context, this book identifies factors helping transitional countries to adapt to regional human rights regimes.\nThe work will be an essential resource for students, academics and policy-makers working in the areas of Constitutional law, Politics and Human Rights law. Its global appeal is enhanced by the methodological framework which is applicable in other international systems.","author":[{"family":"Kosař","given":"David"},{"family":"Petrov","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Šipulová","given":"Katarína"},{"family":"Smekal","given":"Hubert"},{"family":"Vyhnánek","given":"Ladislav"},{"family":"Janovský","given":"Jozef"}],"citation-key":"kosarDomesticJudicialTreatment2020","DOI":"10.4324/9780429343933","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-429-34393-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"number-of-pages":"306","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","title":"Domestic Judicial Treatment of European Court of Human Rights Case Law: Beyond Compliance","title-short":"Domestic Judicial Treatment of European Court of Human Rights Case Law","type":"book"},

TAALES 2.0 is housed on a user’s hard drive (allowing for secure data processing) and is available on most operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux). TAALES 2.0 adds 316 indices to the original tool. These indices are related to word frequency, word range, n-gram frequency, n-gram range, n-gram strength of association, contextual distinctiveness, word recognition norms, semantic network, and word neighbors. In this study, we validated TAALES 2.0 by investigating whether its indices could be used to model both holistic scores of lexical proficiency in free writes and word choice scores in narrative essays. The results indicated that the TAALES 2.0 indices could be used to explain 58% of the variance in lexical proficiency scores and 32% of the variance in word-choice scores. Newly added TAALES 2.0 indices, including those related to n-gram association strength, word neighborhood, and word recognition norms, featured heavily in these predictor models, suggesting that TAALES 2.0 represents a substantial upgrade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kyle","given":"Kristopher"},{"family":"Crossley","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Cynthia"}],"citation-key":"kyleToolAutomaticAnalysis2018","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-017-0924-4","ISSN":"1554-3528","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1030-1046","source":"Springer Link","title":"The tool for the automatic analysis of lexical sophistication (TAALES): version 2.0","title-short":"The tool for the automatic analysis of lexical sophistication (TAALES)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0924-4","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"kymlickaMulticulturalCitizenshipLiberal1995","abstract":"The increasingly multicultural fabric of modern societies has given rise to many new issues and conflicts, as ethnic and national minorities demand recognition and support for their cultural identity. This book presents a new conception of the rights and status of minority cultures. It argues that certain sorts of `collective rights' for minority cultures are consistent with liberal democratic principles, and that standard liberal objections to recognizing such rights on grounds of individual freedom, social justice, and national unity, can be answered. However, Professor Kymlicka emphasises that no single formula can be applied to all groups and that the needs and aspirations of immigrants are very different from those of indigenous peoples and national minorities. The book discusses issues such as language rights, group representation, religious education, federalism, and secession - issues which are central to understanding multicultural politics, but which have been surprisingly neglected in contemporary liberal theory.","author":[{"family":"Kymlicka","given":"Will"}],"citation-key":"kymlickaMulticulturalCitizenshipLiberal1995","ISBN":"978-0-19-152097-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,6,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"300","publisher":"Clarendon Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights","title-short":"Multicultural Citizenship","type":"book"},

But how many of the relevant developments are indeed associated with populism? And is any such association a contingent or analytic matter: Does populism inevitably threaten the rule of law, or do other conditions intervene to shape its impact? After setting out how I understand the rule of law and populism, I examine the ways in which contemporary populist discourse has challenged the rule of law through a variety of mechanisms—notably agenda setting, policy impact, influence on discretionary decisions, and convention trashing—considering the institutional and social conditions that conduce to strengthen or weaken these mechanisms in particular contexts.

  {"id":"landauEvolutionSeparationPowers2018","abstract":"The goals and thinking behind the doctrine of the separation of powers have proven to be so compelling that in virtually all democratic systems across the world, some version of the separation of powers concept has been enshrined in the constitution. The contributors to this volume were motivated by a recognition of the value that the doctrine has but also by the need to re-think its core aspects in light of recent changes both in design and practice. Much recent work has sought to develop new theoretical defenses or reconceptualize the purpose or functioning of the separation of powers. In contrast, this volume examines the evolution of the doctrine in light of important developments that we believe have been underexplored in existing work. First, the recent past has seen important changes in the field of constitutional design. These trends are most pronounced in what Daniel Bonilla has called the constitutions of the “global south,” but they are far from exclusive to new or more fragile democracies. These include questions about the changes in function of existing institutions in light of the inclusion of more expansive lists of rights such as socio-economic rights. They also include the widespread inclusion of independent accountability institutions – such as human rights commissions – whose place within the existing separation of powers is unclear. Secondly, a series of political and technological changes have altered the way the traditional model functions. While these shifts are difficult to generalize across countries, scholars have noted an increase in executive power and a decrease in legislative legitimacy and importance. The chapter examines the implications of these practical shifts for the theory of the separation of powers. Thirdly, we pose the question whether the differences between the constitutionalism that is developing in the global south and the traditional constitutionalism of the global north requires a divergent conception of the separation of powers, or whether a unified theoretical conception is possible. Lastly, we attempt to provide an understanding of how the various chapters in the book tackle the problems we examine.","author":[{"family":"Landau","given":"David"},{"family":"Bilchitz","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"landauEvolutionSeparationPowers2018","container-title":"The Evolution of the Separation of Powers","ISBN":"978-1-78536-976-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,25]]},"language":"en_US","note":"00000","page":"1-28","source":"www.elgaronline.com","title":"The evolution of the separation of powers in the global south and global north","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"larssonJudicialIndependencePolitical2016","abstract":"There is broad agreement in the literature that international courts (ICs) make decisions with bounded discretion in relation to state governments. However, the scope of this discretion, and the determinants of its boundaries, are highly contested. In particular, the central mechanism in separation-of-powers models of judicial politics—the possibility of legislative override—has raised controversy. We argue that the uncertainty that judges face regarding the political reactions to their decisions has important and undertheorized implications for their behavior. On the one hand, cautious judges are likely to be attentive to signals that contain information about the probability of an unfavorable override. On the other hand, misjudgments of the political risks are likely to be made. Thus, the possibility of override is a significant factor affecting judicial behavior, but it is also a fairly blunt mechanism for balancing the independence and accountability of courts. The empirical study focuses on the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which has long been at the center of theory development regarding the legalization of world politics and the rise of international courts. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the CJEU's rulings and the political signals it receives, in a pattern that goes beyond legal merit, and that fits with the override mechanism. State governments are crucial parts of the broader audience that defines the political boundaries of judicial discretion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Larsson","given":"Olof"},{"family":"Naurin","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"larssonJudicialIndependencePolitical2016","container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818316000047","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"2016/ed"},"language":"en","number":"2","page":"377-408","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2117","title":"Judicial Independence and Political Uncertainty: How the Risk of Override Affects the Court of Justice of the EU","title-short":"Judicial Independence and Political Uncertainty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2117/core/journals/international-organization/article/judicial-independence-and-political-uncertainty-how-the-risk-of-override-affects-the-court-of-justice-of-the-eu/99E9DDF41212B57EC14FE880EA1B73BF","volume":"70"},

We review the central features of the initiative, especially its emphasis on the development of empirically useful formal theory and the establishment of a direct link between theory and statistical estimation. We then illustrate the EITM method with an application to a public administration topic. Specifically, we develop a game-theoretic model of policy implementation in order to examine the role of leadership commitment to reform in a staff’s decision to use performance information. We then discuss some of the empirical implications of the theoretical model and examine a couple of them by analyzing data from a 2007 Government Accountability Office survey of federal agency managers. Consistent with the theoretical model, the statistical analysis reveals that leadership commitment is not positively related to performance information use when one focuses on low-to-moderate levels of commitment.

The case-space model is an adaption of standard policy-space modeling, tailored for the distinguishing features of judicial policy making. It allows for ideological differences between judges while expressing those differences in terms of legal rules that partition fact-filled legal cases into different dispositions.

This article studies this question in Chechnya, where state law coexists with Sharia and customary law. The author focuses on the effect of conflict-induced disruption of gender hierarchies because the dominant interpretations of religious and customary norms are discriminatory against women. The author finds that women in Chechnya are more likely than men to rely on state law and that this gender gap in legal preferences and behavior is especially large in more-victimized communities. The author infers from this finding that the conflict created the conditions for women in Chechnya to pursue their interests through state law—albeit not without resistance. Women’s legal mobilization has generated a backlash from the Chechen government, which has attempted to reinstate a patriarchal order.

This study shows that the single most common court behaviour is to support legal integration by referring politically sensitive cases and expressing support for EU law. However, by examining the two choices together, this article also uncovers previously untheorised patterns of behaviour. These findings show that the national courts’ behaviour is not limited to either supporting or resisting integration. Instead, it is suggested that national courts may regularly contribute to striking a balance between EU integration and member state autonomy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Leijon","given":"Karin"}],"citation-key":"leijonNationalCourtsPreliminary2020","container-title":"West European Politics","container-title-short":"West European Politics","DOI":"10.1080/01402382.2020.1738113","ISSN":"0140-2382, 1743-9655","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,23]]},"language":"en","page":"1-21","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"National courts and preliminary references: supporting legal integration, protecting national autonomy or balancing conflicting demands?","title-short":"National courts and preliminary references","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2020.1738113"},

We operationalize culture with data on cultural dimensions for some 50 nations adopted from cross-cultural psychology and generate testable hypotheses about three basic social norms of governance: the rule of law, corruption, and democratic accountability. These norms correlate systematically and strongly with national scores on cultural dimensions and also differ across cultural regions of the world. Using a linguistic variable on pronoun drop as an instrument for cultural emphases on autonomy versus embeddedness points to a significant influence of culture on governance. Using cultural profiles of a previous generation as an instrument indicates relative stability of cultural orientations and of their correlates.

In particular, the Ger- man Federal Constitutional Court (GFCC) is internationally known not only for its strength as a national institution but also as the inventor of a now internationally established decision-making tech- nique: the proportionality test. To better understand the behavior of the court beyond its decision outcomes, we use argument mining approaches to classify decisions of the GFCC regarding whether they invoke proportionality or not. Thereby, our paper makes three contributions: Firstly, it critically discusses the understanding of argument in the argument mining literature and introduces proportion- ality as a legal argument technique. Secondly, it presents a new dataset in which proportionality was annotated at the sentence level in 300 decisions. Thirdly, rule-based and machine-learning methods for classifying decisions are tested.","author":[{"family":"Lüders","given":"Kilian"},{"family":"Stohlman","given":"Bent"}],"citation-key":"ludersProportionalityArgumentIdentification2023","container-title":"DRAFT for 5th ANNUAL COMPTEXT Conference","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"title":"Proportionality as an argument: Identification of a judicial decision technique","type":"article-journal"},

As a consequence, it describes and analyzes its premises, the basic concepts it constructs, the particular type of subject it creates, and the notions of time and space it forms. The chapter is divided into four sections. The first section presents the key components of the current dominant interpretation of the principle separation of powers. The second section explores the concept of subject constructed by the principle of separation of powers. It constructs a collective subject, the State, which is anthropomorphized and presented as a victimizer and an individual subject, an abstract individual that is articulated as a victim of the collective subject. The third section of the chapter, studies the notion of time constructed by the principle of separation of powers. The concept of time has two dimensions. The first is the circular and infinite notion of time in which the principle operates. The second is the notion of time that intersects with the idea of social change that overlaps with the principle of separation of powers. The fourth and last section of the chapter examines the concept of space constructed by the principle of separation of powers. The conceptual geography elaborated by the principle has multiple levels. The primary one is that of the nation-state. Nevertheless, the space of the principle also has dimensions that are internal and external to this way of thinking about the organization of a political community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Maldonado","given":"Daniel Bonilla"}],"citation-key":"maldonadoConceptualArchitecturePrinciple2018","container-title":"The Evolution of the Separation of Powers","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,25]]},"language":"en_US","source":"www.elgaronline.com","title":"The conceptual architecture of the principle of separation of powers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781785369766/9781785369766.00012.xml"},

  {"id":"mandersonKangarooCourtsRule2012","abstract":"Kangaroo Courts and the Rule of Law -The Legacy of Modernism addresses the legacy of contemporary critiques of language for the concept of the rule of law. Between those who care about the rule of law and those who are interested in contemporary legal theory, there has been a dialogue of the deaf, which cannot continue. Starting from the position that contemporary critiques of linguistic meaning and legal certainty are too important to be dismissed, Desmond Manderson takes up the political and intellectual challenge they pose. Can the rule of law be re-configured in light of the critical turn of the past several years in legal theory, rather than being steadfastly opposed to it? Pursuing a reflection upon the relationship between law and the humanities, the book stages an encounter between the influential theoretical work of Jacques Derrida and MIkhail Bakhtin, and D.H. Lawrence's strange and misunderstood novel Kangaroo (1923). At a critical juncture in our intellectual history - the modernist movement at the end of the first world war - and struggling with the same problems we are puzzling over today, Lawrence articulated complex ideas about the nature of justice and the nature of literature. Using Lawrence to clarify Derrida's writings on law, as well as using Derrida and Bakhtin to clarify Lawrence's experience of literature, Manderson makes a robust case for 'law and literature.' With this framework in mind he outlines a 'post-positivist' conception of the rule of law - in which justice is imperfectly possible, rather than perfectly impossible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Manderson","given":"Desmond"}],"citation-key":"mandersonKangarooCourtsRule2012","event-place":"London, UNITED KINGDOM","ISBN":"978-0-203-12363-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"publisher":"Taylor & Francis Group","publisher-place":"London, UNITED KINGDOM","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"Kangaroo Courts and the Rule of Law: The Legacy of Modernism","title-short":"Kangaroo Courts and the Rule of Law","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/huberlin-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3060977"},

In this paper we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. We are particularly interested in determining to what extent ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the Court. This is important because judicial politics scholars oftentimes invoke preference measures that are time invariant. To investigate preference change, we posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian methods for fitting multivariate dynamic linear models to political scientists. Our results suggest that many justices do not have temporally constant ideal points. Moreover, our ideal point estimates outperform existing measures and explain judicial behavior quite well across civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Kevin M."}],"citation-key":"martinDynamicIdealPoint2002","container-title":"Political Analysis","DOI":"10.1093/pan/10.2.134","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,4]]},"language":"en","page":"134-153","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Dynamic Ideal Point Estimation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo for the U.S. Supreme Court, 1953–1999","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/dynamic-ideal-point-estimation-via-markov-chain-monte-carlo-for-the-us-supreme-court-19531999/2A57930D5D0C81216491B40CA2BA5D12","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"martinicoPolemicalSpiritEuropean2015a","abstract":"Recently, scholars have argued of the necessity of going beyond “judicial dialogues” and “conflict-and-power” approaches to the analysis of the role of national Constitutional Courts in the Union. On the one hand, there are risks connected to a “too welcoming an approach by national constitutional courts to EU law”; on the other hand, it is possible to criticize both the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) and some national Constitutional Courts for other, less cooperative, decisions. I share this cautious approach for many reasons, and primarily because the preliminary ruling mechanism does not exhaust all the possible means of communication between constitutional courts and the CJEU. For instance, what Komárek calls “parallel references” can serve, in some circumstances, as a technique of alternative (or hidden) dialogue, that has favored a sort of “remote dialogue” over the years. My sole point of disagreement with this scholarly position is over the role of conflicts in this scenario. Whilst Komárek seems to confine conflicts to phenomena of mere resistance or to “‘cold’ strategic considerations,” in this work I am going to adopt a much broader idea of conflict, which goes beyond mere “conflicts and power games.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Martinico","given":"Giuseppe"}],"citation-key":"martinicoPolemicalSpiritEuropean2015a","container-title":"German Law Journal","DOI":"10.1017/S2071832200021179","ISSN":"2071-8322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12]]},"language":"en","number":"6","page":"1343-1374","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2117","title":"The “Polemical” Spirit of European Constitutional Law: On the Importance of Conflicts in EU Law","title-short":"The “Polemical” Spirit of European Constitutional Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2117/core/journals/german-law-journal/article/polemical-spirit-of-european-constitutional-law-on-the-importance-of-conflicts-in-eu-law/06464D378C79FB08068E638E86A8C460","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"mattliRevisitingEuropeanCourt1998","abstract":"The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is widely recognized not only as an important actor in the process of European integration but also as a strategic actor in its own right. In the last four years the literature on the Court has dramatically expanded, nourishing a lively debate between neofunctionalists and intergovernmentalists. But this debate has now reached the limits of its usefulness. Both neofunctionalism and intergovernmentalism neglect the range of specific motives and constraints shaping the behavior of individual litigants and national courts; further, both insist on modeling the state as a unitary actor. New scholarship on public interest and corporate litigants in the EU and on the relationship between the ECJ and national courts highlights these failings. Reviewing the literature, this essay develops a model of the legal integration process that encompasses disaggregated state actors—courts, regulatory agencies, executives, and legislatures—interacting with both supranational institutions and private actors in domestic and transnational society. It distills new data and theoretical insights to specify the preferences of some of these actors and the constraints they face in implementing those preferences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattli","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Slaughter","given":"Anne-Marie"}],"citation-key":"mattliRevisitingEuropeanCourt1998","container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1162/002081898550590","ISSN":"1531-5088, 0020-8183","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"1998/ed"},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"177-209","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Revisiting the European Court of Justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/abs/revisiting-the-european-court-of-justice/4F573901754D8D35742CC1966E21D501","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"mayoralJudicialEmpowermentExpanded2019","abstract":"Scholars in EU studies have developed diverse justifications for explaining why national judges cooperate with the Court of Justice of the European Union. In this regard, judicial empowerment theories have stressed the strategic importance of cooperation for empowering national courts vis-à-vis high courts and political actors. Nevertheless, these explanations have been restricted to the use of preliminary references by lower courts. This contribution expands the explanatory power of these approaches by exploring other potential scenarios and instruments that national judges can use to challenge the position of their governments and judicial superiors, for example, by emphasising the importance of CJEU precedent for their strategic behaviour. By offering new data collected from case-law and surveys, this article offers a more systematic assessment of the relevance of cooperation for national judges to reinforce their authority against other institutions. The findings call for a revision of the traditional understanding of judicial empowerment theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayoral","given":"Juan A."}],"citation-key":"mayoralJudicialEmpowermentExpanded2019","container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/eulj.12334","ISSN":"1468-0386","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"374-393","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Judicial empowerment expanded: Political determinants of national courts' cooperation with the CJEU","title-short":"Judicial empowerment expanded","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eulj.12334","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"menonTransnationalLegitimacyGlobalising2008","abstract":"This article addresses claims regarding the limited legitimacy of international institutions. It argues that the two original appointed supranational institutions of the European Union play a crucial, if systematically underestimated, role not merely in providing legitimacy for the Union itself, but also in shoring up that of its constituent member states. We illustrate that supranationalism enhances national legitimacy in functional, political and administrative terms. It does so by helping member states produce outputs they otherwise could not (particularly by enabling them to deal with transboundary policy problems they would struggle to confront if acting in isolation) and by embedding within national political and administrative systems legally enforceable obligations to respect the interests of actors whose voice is excluded or muffled (de jure or de facto) within purely national political processes. The article contends that the claims to legitimacy made by the EU and its member states are of distinctive character but interdependent and mutually reinforcing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Menon","given":"Anand"},{"family":"Weatherill","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"menonTransnationalLegitimacyGlobalising2008","container-title":"West European Politics","container-title-short":"null","DOI":"10.1080/01402380801939610","ISSN":"0140-2382","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,5,1]]},"number":"3","page":"397-416","publisher":"Routledge","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk (Atypon)","title":"Transnational Legitimacy in a Globalising World: How the European Union Rescues its States","title-short":"Transnational Legitimacy in a Globalising World","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2398/doi/full/10.1080/01402380801939610","volume":"31"},

However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Jacob M."},{"family":"Nyhan","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Torres","given":"Michelle"}],"citation-key":"montgomeryHowConditioningPosttreatment2018","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","ISSN":"0092-5853","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"760-775","publisher":"[Midwest Political Science Association, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"How Conditioning on Posttreatment Variables Can Ruin Your Experiment and What to Do about It","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26598780","volume":"62"},

Students and staﬀ members seem to behave in a way which could be counterproductive to the development of self-directed learning. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we brieﬂy describe the cognitive psychological background of PBL.

Arguments are presented about adverse eﬀects on the implementation of this educational innovation. Special attention is given to teachers’ concerns.

Existing studies have traced how lower national courts began cooperating with the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to apply EU law because this empowered them to challenge government policies and the decisions of their domestic judicial superiors. We argue that the institutional dynamics identified by this ‘judicial empowerment thesis’ proved self-eroding over time, incentivizing domestic high courts to reassert control over national judicial hierarchies and to influence the development EU law in ways that were also encouraged by the ECJ. We support our argument by combining an analysis of a dataset of cases referred to the ECJ with comparative case study and interview evidence. We conclude that while these evolving judicial politics signal the institutional maturation of the EU legal order, they also risk weakening the decentralized enforcement of European law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Pavone","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Kelemen","given":"R.

  {"id":"perelmanNewRhetoricTreatise1973","abstract":"The New Rhetoric is founded on the idea that since “argumentation aims at securing the adherence of those to whom it is addressed, it is, in its entirety, relative to the audience to be influenced,” says Chaïm Perelman and L. Olbrechts-Tyteca, and they rely, in particular, for their theory of argumentation on the twin concepts of universal and particular audiences: while every argument is directed to a specific individual or group, the orator decides what information and what approaches will achieve the greatest adherence according to an ideal audience. This ideal, Perelman explains, can be embodied, for example, \"in God, in all reasonable and competent men, in the man deliberating or in an elite.” Like particular audiences, then, the universal audience is never fixed or absolute but depends on the orator, the content and goals of the argument, and the particular audience to whom the argument is addressed. These considerations determine what information constitutes \"facts\" and \"reasonableness\" and thus help to determine the universal audience that, in turn, shapes the orator's approach. /// The adherence of an audience is also determined by the orator's use of values, a further key concept of the New Rhetoric. Perelman's treatment of value and his view of epideictic rhetoric sets his approach apart from that of the ancients and of Aristotle in particular. Aristotle's division of rhetoric into three genres–forensic, deliberative, and epideictic–is largely motivated by the judgments required for each: forensic or legal arguments require verdicts on past action, deliberative or political rhetoric seeks judgment on future action, and epideictic or ceremonial rhetoric concerns values associated with praise or blame and seeks no specific decisions. For Aristotle, the epideictic genre was of limited importance in the civic realm since it did not concern facts or policies. Perelman, in contrast, believes not only that epideictic rhetoric warrants more attention, but that the values normally limited to that genre are in fact central to all argumentation. \"Epideictic oratory,\" Perelman argues, \"has significant and important argumentation for strengthening the disposition toward action by increasing adherence to the values it lauds.” These values are central to the persuasiveness of arguments in all rhetorical genres since the orator always attempts to \"establish a sense of communion centered around particular values recognized by the audience.”","author":[{"family":"Perelman","given":"Chaïm"},{"family":"Olbrechts-Tyteca","given":"Lucie"}],"citation-key":"perelmanNewRhetoricTreatise1973","event-place":"Notre Dame, Indiana","ISBN":"978-0-268-17509-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1973,10,31]]},"language":"en","note":"00268","number-of-pages":"639","publisher":"University of Notre Dame Pess","publisher-place":"Notre Dame, Indiana","source":"Google Books","title":"The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation","title-short":"The New Rhetoric","type":"book"},

  {"id":"peterg.stillmanConceptLegitimacy1974","abstract":"Stillman offers his own definition of legitimacy; in the course of explication he usefully illuminates the meanings and problems of the concept. He seeks to use the strengths of traditional definitions (which include reference to possession or pursuit of right values) and modern social science (notably Carl Friedrich's) conceptions of legitimacy. He offers the definition: the compatibility of the results of governmental output with the value patterns of the relevant systems, that is, those affected by these results (especially the value pattern of the society, but also of individuals, groups, and other societies). The definition relates legitimacy to the values of the society, but does not hinge it on popular opinion about the government. Taking legitimacy to be a matter of degree rather than of either/or, the definition is held to be empirically useful, that is, to permit \"operationalization,\" building, for example, on some of Lasswell's work. In sum, we are helped in inquiring into what justifies a particular system of ruling and what is the status of any specific regime.","author":[{"family":"Peter G.

  {"id":"pistorSocialNormsRule2009","abstract":"The rule-of-law is a powerful concept that has inspired political theorists over\nthe centuries. More recently it has become one of the dominant paradigms for\nsocial and economic reforms and policy agendas at multilateral institutions, such\nas the World Bank,2 or for interest group organizations, like the American Bar\nAssociation.3 The enthusiasm for the rule-of-law as a remedy for a range of\nsocial and economic ills is supported by empirical data showing a strong\npositive association between measures of the rule-of-law and a host of desirable\noutcome variables, ranging from levels of GDP, foreign direct investment, and\ntrade ﬂows, all the way to human rights and child mortality data.4 Rule of law\nproponents are not, however, without their critics. Some of the most forcefully\nvoiced critiques focus on measurement issues (Voigt 2008); others on the\ninterpretation of the data and their translation into policy prescriptions (Arndt\nand Oman 2006); while still others have questioned whether the observed\nempirical aﬃnity between rule-of-law and diﬀerent outcome variables has been\nsuﬃciently theorized to generate meaningful insights (Thomas 2007).\nIn this chapter we raise a diﬀerent issue, namely the limited ability of “rule-of-law” to explain observable diﬀerences within a given country. More speciﬁcally, we focus on minorities that either do not share in whatever beneﬁts are\ncommonly associated with rule-of-law reforms or else share in the beneﬁts\nonly indirectly in ways that are insuﬃciently understood. We analyze these\n“minorities” by focusing on women as an example. Our claim is that the basic\ninsights this chapter generates could be applied to other disadvantaged social\ngroups as well.\nTechnically speaking, women are not a minority. In principle the numbersof men and women in any given society should be roughly equal. Nonetheless,\nin many countries males outnumber women by a signiﬁcant margin – a phenomenon Amartya Sen has famously described as the “missing women” (Sen\n1989).5 This gender gap has been attributed to both sex selective foeticide and\nfemale infanticide, but also, crucially, neglect of girl children, which substantially lowers life expectancy for infant girls. Further, in some countries theratio of women to men has worsened recently, suggesting that this phenomenon cannot be traced to historical legacies or rates of poverty alone.6 This\nincludes countries with impressive recent economic growth achievements, such\nas China and India. But mortality rates are, of course, only the crudest way of\nmeasuring the status of women in society. Indeed, over the past decade a\nnumber of indices have been created that seek to measure women’s “capabilities” more broadly (the UN’s Gender Development and Gender Empowerment Indices, GDI and GEM), women’s achievements or status in relation to\nmen (the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index, GAP), as well as the\nlegal and social institutions that determine the status of women (the OECD’s\nGender Institutions and Development Index, GID). In order to provide a fuller\naccount of the status and well-being of women in a society, we will discuss\nthese various indices in the paper and will explore their relationship with\nwidely recognized rule-of-law indicators. In addition, we will analyze speciﬁc\nlegal interventions at the international and national levels aimed at aﬀecting\nthe status of women in society and assess their results.\nAt the very outset, we would like to emphasize that this chapter does notpurport to explain the status of women in society. Instead, it uses a gendered\napproach to expose the limits of the dominant rule-of-law paradigm and to\nsuggest new avenues for future research and policy considerations.\nThe chapter is divided into three parts. Part A explores the relation betweenthe rule-of-law and the status of women in society using existing data sets.\nPart B assesses the impact of speciﬁc legal policy interventions on gender reality at the international and the national levels. Part C uses the ﬁndings of\nParts A and B as the basis for a critique of the dominant rule-of-law paradigm.\nIn the conclusion, we make suggestions for future research and policy design.The current fascination with the rule-of-law is closely associated with the\nforays that economics and political science have made into the ﬁeld of law and\nlegal institutions and the technologies they have brought to this ﬁeld – including, although not limited to, the ability to quantify institutions and use statistical\ntools to assess their impact. The importance of the rule-of-law for economic\ndevelopment was ﬁrst documented in quantitative terms by Knack and Keefer\n(1994), as well as Mauro (1995). These early studies relied heavily on single\nsurveys primarily of foreign investors and their perception of the rule of law in\nthe host countries in which they were investing.7 In these studies, rule of law\nwas a component variable based on several questions that asked about the\ndominance of formal legal devices over others, including violence, politics, or\npersonal relations, for resolving disputes primarily in the realm of contracts\nand property. Over the past 15 years, both survey techniques, and the construction of indices have improved. The most comprehensive indices related to\nthe rule-of-law currently available are the World Bank’s governance indicators,also referred to as the WGI (Kaufmann et al. 2007b). The WGI measure various\ndimensions of governance such as the “rule of law” and “government eﬀectiveness.” The indices are based on surveys and combine the results from a\nvariety of diﬀerent sources. By averaging information from multiple data sources,\nthe WGI seek to mitigate the idiosyncrasies of individual survey instruments in\nan attempt to enhance their informational content.8 The WGI have been\nwidely used in the literature to assert the importance of the rule of law.\nNevertheless, using survey instruments to measure the quality of institutionsremains highly problematic. Sampling issues loom large, as well as concerns\nabout the familiarity of respondents with the institutions they are queried\nabout, and the implicit benchmark they might be using when ranking the\ninstitutions of a particular country on a scale. To avoid these problems, other\nindices have sought to measure the rule-of-law in a more objective fashion.\nThe most comprehensive index based on close readings of constitutions and\nlegal statutes is the “Political Constraints Index” (PolCon) developed by\nWitold Henisz (2000).9 The primary purpose of the PolCon index is to measure the formal constraints on state power by recording the number of institutionalized vetoes in a given political system. Interestingly, the two indices\nseem to capture diﬀerent aspects of the rule-of-law, indicated by the less than\nperfect correlation between them (see Table 11.1). In the empirical tests that\nfollow, we use both PolCon and the “rule of law” (ROL) index from the WGI\nin order to show that our results are robust for at least two fairly dissimilar\nmeasures of the rule of law, both of which are used widely in the literature.\nAgainst the backdrop of numerous empirical studies that show a positivecorrelation between rule-of-law (ROL) or Political Constraints (PolCon) and a\nhost of desirable outcome variables, one might expect that a similar relationship\nwould also hold between rule-of-law and the status of women in society. But as\nper a new worldwide survey instrument by the Economic Forum in Davos measuring the “gender gap,” equality between men and women – in the sense of equal\naccess to political, economic, and social positions of power – has not been\nachieved in any society. According to the 2007 Gender GAP data, Sweden, is\nthe highest-ranking country, with a score of 0.8146 on the Gender Gap index,\nwhere a ratio of 1.0 would indicate full equality. Thus, even in Sweden there is\nstill a substantial gap between men and women (Hausmann et al. 2007: 7).","author":[{"family":"Pistor","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Haldar","given":"Antara"},{"family":"Amirapu","given":"Amrit"}],"citation-key":"pistorSocialNormsRule2009","container-title":"Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law","ISBN":"978-0-203-87059-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"number-of-pages":"38","publisher":"Routledge-Cavendish","title":"Social norms, rule of law, and gender reality: An essay on the limits of the dominant rule-of-law paradigm","title-short":"Social norms, rule of law, and gender reality","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"posnerHowJudgesThink2010","abstract":"A distinguished and experienced appellate court judge, Richard A. Posner offers in this new book a unique and, to orthodox legal thinkers, a startling perspective on how judges and justices decide cases. When conventional legal materials enable judges to ascertain the true facts of a case and apply clear pre-existing legal rules to them, Posner argues, they do so straightforwardly; that is the domain of legalist reasoning. However, in non-routine cases, the conventional materials run out and judges are on their own, navigating uncharted seas with equipment consisting of experience, emotions, and often unconscious beliefs. In doing so, they take on a legislative role, though one that is confined by internal and external constraints, such as professional ethics, opinions of respected colleagues, and limitations imposed by other branches of government on freewheeling judicial discretion. Occasional legislators, judges are motivated by political considerations in a broad and sometimes a narrow sense of that term. In that open area, most American judges are legal pragmatists. Legal pragmatism is forward-looking and policy-based. It focuses on the consequences of a decision in both the short and the long term, rather than on its antecedent logic. Legal pragmatism so understood is really just a form of ordinary practical reasoning, rather than some special kind of legal reasoning.Supreme Court justices are uniquely free from the constraints on ordinary judges and uniquely tempted to engage in legislative forms of adjudication. More than any other court, the Supreme Court is best understood as a political court.","author":[{"family":"Posner","given":"Richard A."}],"citation-key":"posnerHowJudgesThink2010","ISBN":"978-0-674-03383-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,5,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"399","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"How Judges Think","type":"book"},

  {"id":"radinReconsideringRuleLaw2017","abstract":"\"The rule of law is frequently invoked in political debate, yet rarely defined with any precision. Some employ it as a synonym for democracy, others for the subordination of the legislature to a written constitution and its judicial guardians. It has been seen as obedience to the duly-recognised government, a form of governing through formal and general rule-like laws and the rule of principle. Given this diversity of view, it is perhaps unsurprising that certain scholars have regarded the concept as no more than a self-congratulatory rhetorical device. This collection of eighteen key essays from jurists, political theorists and public law political scientists, aims to explore the role law plays in the political system. The introduction evaluates their arguments. The first eleven essays identify the standard features associated with the rule of law. These are held to derive less from any characteristics of law per se than from a style of legislating and judging that gives equal consideration to all citizens. The next seven essays then explore how different ways of separating and dispersing power contribute to this democratic style of rule by forcing politicians and judges alike to treat people as equals and regard none as above the law.\"--Provided by publisher.","author":[{"family":"Radin","given":"Margaret Jane"}],"citation-key":"radinReconsideringRuleLaw2017","container-title":"The Rule of Law and the Separation of Powers","ISBN":"978-1-315-08530-2 978-1-351-54070-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 994229083","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Reconsidering the Rule of Law","type":"chapter"},

It re-orientates the entire EU judicial architecture towards protecting individual rights grounded in EU law. The article makes three supporting arguments: First, the norm of judicial protection has become institutionalised in law, through the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Treaty on European Union and relating jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the Court). Further, as judicial protection becomes a meta-norm, capable of overriding even conflicting primary EU law that would preserve the discretion of the political EU institutions or the procedural autonomy of the Member States. Finally, by reference to the norm of judicial protection, the Court’s doctrine has been shaping a single code of procedure that welds the entire twin-pillared EU judicial architecture into a coherent whole. The article documents this single code of procedure for a horizontal dimension of the Court of Justice of the EU and a vertical dimension of the Member States courts. The implications of this rise of judicial protection to meta-norm applies to a wide variety of debates on the judicial architecture, ranging from a EU federal question jurisdiction of Member States courts, enforcement of the independence of the judiciary in the sovereign Member States, to the integration of international and third-country courts. The article concludes that the ultimate legitimacy of European integration depends on rights being taken seriously through their guaranteed judicial protection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Roeben","given":"Volker"}],"citation-key":"roebenJudicialProtectionMetanorm2020","container-title":"Hague Journal on the Rule of Law","container-title-short":"Hague J Rule Law","DOI":"10.1007/s40803-019-00085-3","ISSN":"1876-4053","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"29-62","source":"Springer Link","title":"Judicial Protection as the Meta-norm in the EU Judicial Architecture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40803-019-00085-3","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"ropeikHowSocietyShould2013","abstract":"While vaccine acceptance remains high in general, fear of vaccines has grown dramatically in the past several years in many developed countries. In some communities, this fear has led to significantly increased rates of vaccine refusal which are associated with increases in illness and death from vaccine-preventable diseases, and large economic costs for health care and society. Despite overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and benefits of vaccination, this fear has proven resistant to information campaigns, a phenomenon well-explained by psychological research which has established that risk perception is subjective, a product of both the facts and how those facts feel. Given the innately emotional and instinctive nature of risk perception, and the risks to public health these perceptions produce, and consistent with well-established legal principles supporting government action to protect the common good, society has the right and responsibility to establish laws, regulations, and choice frameworks that discourage vaccine refusal.;","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,26]]},"archive_location":"23807359","author":[{"family":"Ropeik","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"ropeikHowSocietyShould2013","container-title":"Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics","container-title-short":"Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics","DOI":"10.4161/hv.25250","ISSN":"2164-554X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8]]},"page":"1815-1818","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"How society should respond to the risk of vaccine rejection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ezproxy.muni.cz/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,cookie,uid&db=mdc&AN=23807359&lang=cs&site=eds-live&scope=site","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"sadurskiPolandConstitutionalBreakdown2019","abstract":"Since 2015, Poland's populist Law and Justice Party (PiS) has been dismantling the major checks and balances of the Polish state and subordinating the courts, the civil service, and the media to the will of the executive. Political rights have been radically restricted, and the Party has captured the entire state apparatus. The speed and depth of these antidemocratic movements took many observers by surprise: until now, Poland was widely regarded as an example of a successful transitional democracy. Poland's anti-constitutional breakdown poses three questions that this book sets out to answer: What, exactly, has happened since 2015? Why did it happen? And what are the prospects for a return to liberal democracy? These answers are formulated against a backdrop of current worldwide trends towards populism, authoritarianism, and what is sometimes called 'illiberal democracy'. As this book argues, the Polish variant of 'illiberal democracy' is an oxymoron. By undermining the separation of powers, the PiS concentrates all power in its own hands, rendering any democratic accountability illusory. There is, however, no inevitability in these anti-democratic trends: this book considers a number of possible remedies and sources of hope, including intervention by the European Union.","author":[{"family":"Sadurski","given":"Wojciech"}],"citation-key":"sadurskiPolandConstitutionalBreakdown2019","event-place":"Oxford, New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-884050-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"note":"00014","number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, New York","source":"Oxford University Press","title":"Poland's Constitutional Breakdown","type":"book"},

  {"id":"salmonCompulsoryVaccinationConscientious2006","abstract":"Compulsory vaccination has contributed to the success of immunisation programmes in the USA and Australia, yet the benefits from compulsory vaccination are not universally recognised. Some people--experts and the public alike--believe that the benefits of compulsory vaccination are outweighed by the associated ethical problems. A review of vaccination legislation in the UK, Australia, and the USA raises four main points. First, compulsory vaccination may be effective in preventing disease outbreaks, reaching and sustaining high immunisation coverage rates, and expediting the introduction of new vaccines. Second, to be effective, compulsory programmes must have a reliable supply of safe and effective vaccines and most people must be willing to be vaccinated. Third, allowance of exemptions to compulsory vaccination may limit public backlash. Finally, compulsory vaccination may increase the burden on governments to ensure the safety of vaccines. Nevertheless, although compulsory immunisation can be very effective, it might not be acceptable in some countries where high coverage has been achieved through other approaches or efforts, such as in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK. These factors should be considered when compulsory vaccinations are being introduced or immunisation laws refined. Lessons learned from compulsory vaccination could be useful to other public-health programmes.;","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,28]]},"archive_location":"16458770","author":[{"family":"Salmon","given":"Daniel A"},{"family":"Teret","given":"Stephen P"},{"family":"MacIntyre","given":"C Raina"},{"family":"Salisbury","given":"David"},{"family":"Burgess","given":"Margaret A"},{"family":"Halsey","given":"Neal A"}],"citation-key":"salmonCompulsoryVaccinationConscientious2006","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet (London, England)","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"9508","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,2,4]]},"page":"436-442","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future","title-short":"Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ezproxy.muni.cz/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,cookie,uid&db=mdc&AN=16458770&lang=cs&site=eds-live&scope=site","volume":"367"},

  {"id":"saxonbergNeoliberalismDecayEvolution2009","abstract":"In this article we analyse the evolution of the Czech welfare state and we examine the factors explaining its path. We show that although the Czech welfare regime exhibits a ‘mixed profile’ that includes conservative and universalist elements, it is increasingly moving in a more liberal, residualist direction – not because of conscious steps but rather through decay. Governments have often zig-zagged in their policies and resorted to symbolic reforms at times rather than implementing ideologically based, consistent policies. We argue that historical and sociological institutionalism combined with a social-capital approach can explain this decay better than the more common arguments about economic pressures combined with ideological hegemony or the protest-avoidance strategy. In particular, the social capital approach adds to our institutional framework by explaining why cutbacks in welfare programmes have not met much opposition, even though public opinion surveys consistently show support for more generous welfare policies, and why policies have deviated so much from political rhetoric.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Saxonberg","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Sirovátka","given":"Tomáš"}],"citation-key":"saxonbergNeoliberalismDecayEvolution2009","container-title":"Social Policy & Administration","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9515.2009.00655.x","ISSN":"1467-9515","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","page":"186-203","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Neo-liberalism by Decay?

  {"id":"scheppeleEUValuesAre2021","abstract":"Although compliance with the founding values is presumed in its law, the Union is now confronted with persistent disregard of these values in two Member States. If it ceases to be a union of Rule-of-Law-abiding democracies, the European Union (EU) is unthinkable. Purely political mechanisms to safeguard the Rule of Law, such as those in Article 7 Treaty of European Union (TEU), do not work. Worse still, their existence has disguised the fact that the violations of the values of Article 2 TEU are also violations of EU law. The legal mechanisms tried thus far, however, do not work either. The fundamental jurisprudence on judicial independence and irremovability under Article 19(1) TEU is a good start, but it has been unable to change the situation on the ground. Despite ten years of EU attempts at reining in Rule of Law violations and even as backsliding Member States have lost cases at the Court of Justice, illiberal regimes inside the EU have become more consolidated: the EU has been losing through winning. More creative work is needed to find ways to enforce the values of Article 2 TEU more effectively. Taking this insight, we propose to turn the EU into a militant democracy, able to defend its basic principles, by using the traditional tools for the enforcement of EU law in a novel manner. We demonstrate how the familiar infringement actions—both under Article 258 and 259 TFEU—can be adapted as instruments for enforcing EU values by bundling a set of specific violations into a single general infringement action to show how a pattern of unlawful activity rises to the level of being a systemic violation. A systemic violation, because of its general and pervasive nature, in itself threatens basic values above and beyond violations of individual provisions of the acquis. Certified by the Court of Justice, a systemic violation of EU law should call for systemic compliance that would require the Member State to undo the effects of its attacks on the values of Article 2. The use of Article 260 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) to deduct fines from EU funds due to be received by the troubled Member State would provide additional incentives for systemic compliance. We illustrate this proposed militant democratic structure by explaining and critiquing what the Commission and Court together have done to reign in the governments of Hungary and Poland so far and then showing how they can do better.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheppele","given":"Kim Lane"},{"family":"Kochenov","given":"Dimitry Vladimirovich"},{"family":"Grabowska-Moroz","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"scheppeleEUValuesAre2021","container-title":"Yearbook of European Law","container-title-short":"Yearbook of European Law","DOI":"10.1093/yel/yeaa012","ISSN":"0263-3264","issue":"yeaa012","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"EU Values Are Law, after All: Enforcing EU Values through Systemic Infringement Actions by the European Commission and the Member States of the European Union","title-short":"EU Values Are Law, after All","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/yel/yeaa012"},

The powers to make, execute, and interpret law were to be separated not merely in order to make of law an efficient instrument of behavior guidance. However, according to the “formal” or “thin” vision, efficient behavior guidance is the basic idea underpinning the Rule of Law. Insofar as the formal vision promises to sharpen the knife of state power, but says nothing about a countervailing shield, it offers no reassurance to citizens who are called upon to give up their own powers to those who would wield the knife.

  {"id":"serranoSpanishConstitutionalCourt2015","abstract":"The purpose of the preliminary reference procedure is to ensure a uniform application and interpretation of Community law across all the Member States, including European fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The entry into force of the Charter has reinforced the authority of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the field of fundamental rights adjudication. But the Charter may also be a new source of conflicts between the jurisdiction of the CJEU and the jurisdiction of national constitutional courts. Indeed, compliance with the indirect rulings over national law contained in the CJEU decisions became something logical for the national ordinary courts from the beginning of the integration process, but it was not the same for national constitutional courts. Most of them have always disliked the idea of asking for the CJEU's opinion on a conflict of law involving national constitutional provisions. The CJEU succeeded in establishing a legal doctrine through principles of Community law—supremacy and direct effect being the pioneers—that meant a material constitutionalization of the European Union (EU) law system. And for the national constitutional courts, such an understanding of EU law made a rival of the CJEU.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Serrano","given":"Miryam Rodríguez-Izquierdo"}],"citation-key":"serranoSpanishConstitutionalCourt2015","container-title":"German Law Journal","DOI":"10.1017/S2071832200021246","ISSN":"2071-8322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12]]},"language":"en","number":"6","page":"1509-1528","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2117","title":"The Spanish Constitutional Court and Fundamental Rights Adjudication After the First Preliminary Reference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2117/core/journals/german-law-journal/article/spanish-constitutional-court-and-fundamental-rights-adjudication-after-the-first-preliminary-reference/03AA17B9F21E07C5859A6BFCAE4B5E02","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"shapiroLegality2011","abstract":"Legality is a profound work in analytical jurisprudence, the branch of legal philosophy which deals with metaphysical questions about the law. In the twentieth century, there have been two major approaches to the nature of law. The first and most prominent is legal positivism, which draws a sharp distinction between law as it is and law as it might be or ought to be. The second are theories that view law as embedded in a moral framework. Scott Shapiro is a positivist, but one who tries to bridge the differences between the two approaches. In Legality, he shows how law can be thought of as a set of plans to achieve complex human goals. His new “planning” theory of law is a way to solve the “possibility problem”, which is the problem of how law can be authoritative without referring to higher laws.","author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Scott J."}],"citation-key":"shapiroLegality2011","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-05891-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"483","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Google Books","title":"Legality","type":"book"},

While political self-determination has its place in a familiar and common space, cosmopolitan self-determination stands for unbounded collective self-determination among strangers. Two forms can be distinguished. In its mixed form, it is tied in with political self-determination, adopting the latter as a medium for realizing common autonomy among those who are foreign to one another. Virtual representation is essential to understanding how cosmopolitans are connected to bounded political spaces. In its pure form, by contrast, cosmopolitan self-determination detaches itself from political judgement and finds its major role in authorizing risk management and crisis intervention. It lends expression to the impoverishment suffered by collective freedom in an administered world.

  {"id":"sternDetectingDoctrinesCase2011","abstract":"Many scholars have compared legal judgments with detective stories, and have suggested that law professors should teach cases in a way that reflects the structure of detective fiction. This essay explores that analogy, arguing that detective fiction’s asserted concern with the logical analysis of clues helps to show why exponents of legal doctrine would look to this genre as a model. Detective stories changed in the late nineteenth century, for the first time organizing their narrative structure around the use of clues, and hence claiming to promote logical reasoning in a way that allowed the reader to compete with the detective in solving the mystery. This explanation echoes the rationales offered by the advocates of the case method when it was first being endorsed around the same time. Law teaching changed similarly, moving from the methods of lecture and memorization to an approach that required students to navigate a narrative medium (the case) and to discover its essential components on their own. These two developments, in literature and law, stem from a common source - the emergence of new scientific methods aimed at tracing visible effects back to their hidden causes, exemplified by Charles Lyell’s work in geology and Charles Darwin’s work in evolution. When the early advocates of the case method talked about legal science, they emphasized scientific values such as coherence, clarity, and consistency, but an equally important aspect of the enterprise received much less rhetorical emphasis - namely, the method itself, which reflected the forms of scientific inquiry exemplified by Lyell and Darwin.","author":[{"family":"Stern","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"sternDetectingDoctrinesCase2011","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,6]]},"language":"en","note":"00015","number":"ID 1782987","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Detecting Doctrines: The Case Method and the Detective Story","title-short":"Detecting Doctrines","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1782987"},

In fact, one finds a great deal of constitutional pluralism within national legal orders in Europe.

  {"id":"sweetConstructingSupranationalConstitution1998","abstract":"We present a theory of European legal integration that relies on three causal factors: transnational exchange, triadic dispute resolution, and the production of legal norms. After stating the theory in abstract terms, we explain the construction of the legal system and test the relationship among our three variables over the life of the European Community. We then examine the effect of the EC legal system on policy outcomes at both the national and supranational levels in two policy domains: the free movement of goods and gender equality. Our theory outperforms its leading rival, intergovernmentalism. The evidence shows that European integration has generally been driven by transnational activity and the efforts of EC institutions to reduce transaction costs, behavior which governments react to but do not control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Sweet","given":"Alec Stone"},{"family":"Brunell","given":"Thomas L."}],"citation-key":"sweetConstructingSupranationalConstitution1998","container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am Polit Sci Rev","DOI":"10.2307/2585929","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,3]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"63-81","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Constructing a Supranational Constitution: Dispute Resolution and Governance in the European Community","title-short":"Constructing a Supranational Constitution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S000305540020912X/type/journal_article","volume":"92"},

The data, never before collected and analyzed, are coded by date, member state of origin, referring court, legal subject matter of the reference, and other categories, which permit us to construct a dynamic, multidimensional picture of the litigation of EC law across the Community. Using this data, we assess a range of approaches to European legal integration. The evidence corroborates transaction-based theories of integration, and broadly supports approaches that emphasize the transformative impact of the Court's doctrines of supremacy and direct effect.

  {"id":"sweetEuropeanIntegrationSupranational1997","abstract":"We argue that European integration is provoked and sustained by the development of causal connections between three factors: transnational exchange, supranational organization, and European Community (EC) rule-making. We explain the transition, in any given policy sector, from national to intergovernmental to supranational governance, in two ways. First cross-border transactions and communications generate a social demand for EC rules and regulation, which supranational organizations work to supply. We thus expect that Community competences will be unevenly constructed, both across policy sectors and over time, as a function of the intensity of these demands. Second, once EC rules are in place, a process of institutionalization ensues, and this process provokes further integration. Although we recognize the importance of intergovernmental bargaining in EC politics, our theory is not compatible with existing intergovernmental theorizing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sweet","given":"Alec   Stone"},{"family":"Sandholtz","given":"Wayne"}],"citation-key":"sweetEuropeanIntegrationSupranational1997","container-title":"Journal of European Public Policy","container-title-short":"null","DOI":"10.1080/13501769780000011","ISSN":"1350-1763","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,9,1]]},"number":"3","page":"297-317","publisher":"Routledge","source":"ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk (Atypon)","title":"European integration and supranational governance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2398/doi/abs/10.1080/13501769780000011","volume":"4"},

Illustrating the dynamic, the adjudication of the age discrimination provisions of the 2000 Framework Directive on Employment Equality in Germany produced two major outcomes.

Second, the structural position of the German Federal Constitutional Court, as a privileged locus of rights protection, was weakened, while the authority of the labour courts was enhanced.

The author outlines the concerns of Western conservatives about the decline of the rule of law and suggests reasons why the radical Left have promoted this decline. Two basic theoretical streams of the rule of law are then presented, with an examination of the strengths and weaknesses of each.

Legal pluralism is a prominent feature in many development contexts, with both negative and positive implications for the rule of law. The negative questions revolve around whether or to what extent the presence of multiple coexisting legal forms hampers or detracts from efforts to build the rule of law. The positive questions revolve around whether alternative legal forms in situations of legal pluralism might satisfy rule of law functions that failing state legal systems are unable to provide.

The comparative analysis of the Fidesz-led government in Hungary and the Law and Justice government in Poland is used to analyse the policy shifts in different domains. The main claim is that a combination of both domestic ideological change at the level of government and transnationally conditioned structural factors need to be considered to explain the shift towards and the variation in the pursuit of a ‘heterodox’ economic strategy under the two populist governments.

  {"id":"troopWhyLegalFormalism2018","abstract":"Legal formalism is the foil for many theories of law. Yet formalism remains controversial, meaning that its critics focus on claims that are not central. This paper sets out a view of formalism using a methodology that embraces one of formalism’s most distinct claims, that formalism is a scientific theory of law. This naturalistic view of formalism helps to distinguish two distinct types of formalism, “doctrinal formalism,” the view that judicial behaviour can be represented using rules, and “rule formalism,” the view that judges follow external rules when they are deciding cases. Doctrinal formalism, understood in naturalistic terms, overcomes many of the criticisms that have been levelled at formalism and can also be used to rehabilitate the currently out-of-favour “declaratory theory of law.” Doctrinal formalism is also a longstanding view of law, reflecting both what the original formalists thought of law, and what many present-day doctrinal lawyers seem to believe. The naturalistic methodology is used to show that the main dispute between doctrinal formalism and American legal realism can be explained by a difference of assumptions concerning whether the values of judges are relative to society, or relative to other judges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Troop","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"troopWhyLegalFormalism2018","container-title":"Ratio Juris","ISSN":"09521917","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","note":"00000","page":"428-443","source":"Crossref","title":"Why Legal Formalism Is Not a Stupid Thing: Legal Formalism","title-short":"Why Legal Formalism Is Not a Stupid Thing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/raju.12225","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"vatsovEuropeanIntegrationPreliminary2015","abstract":"The preliminary reference procedure under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is instrumental for the so-called “judicial dialogue” within the European Union (EU). The goals of the preliminary reference procedure are to ensure the uniform interpretation and application of EU law and to contribute to the harmonious development of the law throughout the EU. It was through the preliminary reference procedure to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that the principles of direct effect and supremacy were developed. It took many years before the first request by a Constitutional Court was sent to the CJEU. So far, the Constitutional Courts of Belgium, Austria, Lithuania, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and most recently Slovenia, have sent requests for preliminary rulings to the CJEU. By far the most active of these in sending requests has been the Belgian Court. The Portuguese Constitutional Court has indicated that it can request preliminary rulings from the CJEU but is yet to do so. In the other Member States (MS) with Constitutional Courts, references have not been sent yet, although worthy occasions in terms of EU-law-related cases have occurred, as also observed in various contributions in this special issue.

  {"id":"versteegMeasuringRuleLaw2017","abstract":"The rule of law era has given rise to multiple indicators purporting to measure the concept. This article compares four major indicators of the rule of law and shows that their approaches to conceptualization and measurement differ. Given their disparate conceptualizations and measurement strategies, one might expect a weak correlation between them. Strikingly, however, all four indicators are highly correlated with each other (with the pair-wise correlations between three of them exceeding 0.95). They are also correlated with the widely used measure of corruption. This suggests that the indicators might capture a more encompassing concept, like impartial administration. The article critiques the rule of law measurement enterprise as insufficiently linked to the underlying normative concept. It points to the reliance on expert perceptions and information constraints as a possible cause for the convergence. It concludes that measurement strategy, rather than differences in conceptualization, explains the convergence between the indicators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Versteeg","given":"Mila"},{"family":"Ginsburg","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"versteegMeasuringRuleLaw2017","container-title":"Law & Social Inquiry","DOI":"10.1111/lsi.12175","ISSN":"0897-6546, 1747-4469","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"2017/ed"},"language":"en","page":"100-137","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Measuring the Rule of Law: A Comparison of Indicators","title-short":"Measuring the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/abs/measuring-the-rule-of-law-a-comparison-of-indicators/07C5D96A9D83B4C297D49983A8C77479","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"waldronCoreCaseJudicial2006","abstract":"This Essay states the general case against judicial review of legislation clearly and in a way that is uncluttered by discussions of particular decisions or the history of its emergence in particular systems of constitutional law. The Essay criticizes judicial review on two main grounds. First, it argues that there is no reason to suppose that rights are better protected by this practice than they would be by democratic legislatures. Second, it argues that, quite apart from the outcomes it generates, judicial review is democratically illegitimate. The second argument is familiar; the first argument less so. However, the case against judicial review is not absolute or unconditional. In this Essay, it is premised on a number of conditions, including that the society in question has good working democratic institutions and that most of its citizens take rights seriously (even if they may disagree about what rights they have). The Essay ends by considering what follows from the failure of these conditions.","author":[{"family":"Waldron","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"waldronCoreCaseJudicial2006","container-title":"The Yale Law Journal","container-title-short":"The Yale Law Journal","ISSN":"00440094","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"1346","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"The Core of the Case against Judicial Review","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"waldronLawDisagreement1999","abstract":"When people disagree about justice and about individual rights, how should political decisions be made among them? How should they decide about issues like tax policy, welfare provision, criminal procedure, discrimination law, hate speech, pornography, political dissent and the limits of religious toleration? The most familiar answer is that these decisions should be made democratically, by majority voting among the people or their representatives. Often, however, this answer is qualified by adding ' providing that the majority decision does not violate individual rights.' In this book Jeremy Waldron has revisited and thoroughly revised thirteen of his most recent essays. He argues that the familiar answer is correct, but that the qualification about individual rights is incoherent. If rights are the very things we disagree about, then we are quarrelling precisely about what that qualification should amount to. At best, what it means is that disagreements about rights should be resolved by some other procedure, for example, by majority voting, not among the people or their representatives, but among judges in a court. This proposal - although initially attractive - seems much less agreeable when we consider that the judges too disagree about rights, and they disagree about them along exactly the same lines as the citizens. This book offers a comprehensive critique of the idea of the judicial review of legislation. The author argues that a belief in rights is not the same as a commitment to a Bill of Rights. He shows the flaws and difficulties in many common defences of the 'democratic' character of judicial review. And he argues for an alternative approach to the problem of disagreement: when disagreements about rights arise, the respectful way to resolve them is by decision-making among the right-holders on a basis that reflects an equal respect for them as the holders of views about rights. This respect for ordinary right-holders, he argues, has been sadly lacking in the theories of justice, rights, and constitutionalism put forward in recent years by philosophers such as John Rawls and Donald Dworkin. But the book is not only about judicial review. The first tranche of essays is devoted to a theory of legislation, a theory which highlights the size, the scale and the diversity of modern legislative assemblies. Although legislation is often denigrated as a source of law, Waldron seeks to restore its tattered dignity. He deprecates the tendency to disparage legislatures and argues that such disparagement is often a way of bolstering the legitimacy of the courts, as if we had to transform our parliaments into something like the American Congress to justify importing American-style judicial reviews. Law and Disagreement redresses the balances in modern jurisprudence. It presents legislation by a representative assembly as a form of law making which is especially apt for a society whose members disagree with one another about fundamental issues of principle, for it is a form of law making that does not attempt to conceal the fact that our decisions are made and claim their authority in the midst of, not in spite of, our political and moral disagreements. This timely rights-based defence of majoritarian legislation will be welcomed by scholars of legal and political philosophy throughout the world.","author":[{"family":"Waldron","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"waldronLawDisagreement1999","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-102447-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,3,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"350","publisher":"OUP Oxford","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"Law and Disagreement","type":"book"},

  {"id":"waldronSeparationPowersThought2013","abstract":"The rationale of the separation of powers is often elided with the rationale of checks and balances and with the rationale of the dispersal of power generally in a constitutional system. This Essay, however, focuses resolutely on the functional separation of powers in what M.J.C. Vile called its “pure form.” Reexamining the theories of Locke, Montesquieu, and Madison, this Essay seeks to recover (amidst all their tautologies and evasions) a genuine case in favor of this principle. The Essay argues that the rationale of the separation of powers is closely related to that of the rule of law: it is partly a matter of the distinct integrity of each of the separated institutions—judiciary, legislature, and administration. But above all, it is a matter of articulated governance (as contrasted with compressed undifferentiated exercises of power).","author":[{"family":"Waldron","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"waldronSeparationPowersThought2013","container-title":"Boston College Law Review","ISSN":"0161-6587","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"37","source":"Zotero","title":"Separation of Powers in Thought and Practice","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"wennerasMakingEffectiveUse2017","abstract":"This chapter examines the design of Article 260 TFEU and its application by the Commission and the ECJ. Much has been written on Article 260 TFEU, and the refrain continues along the lines that it is a potentially effective instrument for securing compliance with EU law which has yet to materialize. Some have started to question whether pecuniary sanctions can ever be an effective tool and have eyed the political procedure in Article 7 TEU with a glimmer of hope. But since money talks and the conditions in Article 7 TEU are onerous, it seems premature to discard the value of Article 260 TFEU just yet. Hence the chapter considers the issues surrounding Article 260 TFEU and their possible remedies.","author":[{"family":"Wennerås","given":"Pål"}],"citation-key":"wennerasMakingEffectiveUse2017","container-title":"The Enforcement of EU Law and Values: Ensuring Member States' Compliance","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-180848-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,9]]},"language":"en_US","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","title":"Making effective use of Article 260 TFEU","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"wintrAlexyhoVaziciFormule2016","abstract":"The proportionality principle is one of the most important contemporary methodological guidelines for decision-making of constitutional courts. In 2003 Robert Alexy introduced his concept of the Weight Formula as a tool for assessment of the most problematic of the three criteria of the proportionality test. The balancing rule of that last criterion has been described by Robert Alexy as follows: \"Die greater the degree of non-satisfaction of, or detriment to, one right or principle, the greater must be the importance of satisfying the other.\" Alexy's Weight Formula constitutes the subject matter of this paper. The author attempts to elucidate the Formula as clearly as possible and subsequently apply it to a number of selected decisions of the Czech Constitutional Court. The aim of the paper is to experimentally validate the hypothesis that the Weight Formula is a practical as well as convincing instrument of balancing colliding constitutional principles. It should also answer the question to what extent the Formula can help identify the differences in relevant opinions in the event of rational disagreement. The paper concludes the Formula does constitute an applicable instrument of constitutional argumentation. It can be employed in the process of judicial oversight over individual breaches of basic rights as well as exercising constitutional review powers. The Formula's applicability extends even into the sphere of disputes within organic constitutional law. The Weight Formula serves in the very least as a tool to make argumentation of constitutional courts clearer and easier to understand for the public. Among other aspects, the paper reacts to some of the criticisms which have been mounted against the Formula.

  {"id":"zillerUnbearableHeavinessGerman2020","abstract":"The German Federal Court’s judgment on the Public Asset Purchasing Programme (PSPP) and the European Central Bank on the one hand calls into question the supremacy of European Union law. On the other hand, perhaps with some sound arguments, the mentioned Constitutional Court criticized the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for granting very limited judicial protection against acts like the challenged ones. It is the view of the German Federal Constitutional Court that the Court of Justice of the European Union by granting ‘wide discretion’ to the EU institutions, coupled with applying a ‘limited judicial review standard’, would not be able to guarantee appropriate judicial protection against EU law acts, which can be unlawful. We argue here that the reasoning as adopted in the judgment of the German Constitutional is not a new matter in the European Union, as the conflicts between the CJEU and the highest national courts did occur in the past. In fact, the judgment of the German Constitutional Court is a clear indication that according to some of the highest national courts, the unconditional supremacy of the EU law cannot be accepted. Instead, the scope of the interpreted EU measures should also align with the highest level of the national legal norms, such as constitutional norms or fundamental rights.We are also arguing that it would be up to the European Commission to re-establish the order via the infringement proceedings tool, yet that the Commission should be strongly endorsed among the EU Member States for taking such measures. It is, however, possible that the following matter can be resolved without restoring to such measures. From a substantive point of view, however, we have the regret of concluding that the German Federal Constitutional Court raised valid substantive arguments against the Court of Justice of the European Union. Finally we examine the potential scope of implications, which could occur in the trade and customs fields in the European Union.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ziller","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"zillerUnbearableHeavinessGerman2020","container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","container-title-short":"SSRN Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3598179","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Unbearable Heaviness of the German Constitutional Judge on the Judgment of the Second Chamber of the German Federal Constitutional Court of 5 May 2020 Concerning the European Central Bank’s PSPP Programme","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3598179"},
