# court_dissents
This is the repository for a collaborative article on why do Czech Constitutional Court judges dissent. The repository builds on the apex court dataset. 

You can find the current draft of the article in the /report folder.

You can find all the data on my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JRuu0mJyU1NvKX_4H4x3gpQC8JggnNfg). The data are updated on a weekly basis on Sunday evening.
